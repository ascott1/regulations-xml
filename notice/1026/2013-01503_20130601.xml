            <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed to reserve § 226.45(c) for future use in implementing section 1471 of the Dodd- Frank Act, which creates new TILA section 129H to establish certain appraisal requirements applicable to “higher-risk mortgages.” Consistent with that proposal, the Bureau is reserving § 1026.35(c) in this final rule, thus permitting that section to be finalized separately in the 2013 Interagency Appraisals Final Rule, discussed above. As discussed in part III.C, the 2013 Interagency Appraisals Final Rule will take effect subsequent to this final rule.</analysisParagraph>

Section 1026.34(a)(4)(i) and staff comment 34(a)(4)(i)-1 are being amended under the 2013 HOEPA Final Rule to remove the cross-reference to § 1026.35(b)(3)(i).

            <title>Section 1026.20 Subsequent Disclosure Requirements</title>
            <analysisParagraph>In the 2011 Escrows Proposal, the Board proposed a new § 226.20(d) to implement the disclosure requirements of TILA sections 129D(j)(1)(B) and 129D(j)(2), as enacted by section 1462 of the Dodd-Frank Act. TILA section 129D(j)(1)(B) requires a creditor or servicer to provide the disclosures set forth in TILA section 129D(j)(2) when a consumer requests closure of an escrow account that was established in connection with a transaction secured by real property. Proposed § 226.20(d) would have directed the creditor or servicer to disclose the information about escrow accounts in accordance with certain format and timing requirements. As previously noted, the Bureau has delayed the implementation of certain disclosure requirements contained in title XIV of the Dodd-Frank Act, including those contained in sections 1461 and 1462. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 77 FR 70105 (Nov. 23, 2012).

              <title>Creditor and Affiliates Do Not Maintain Escrows</title>
              <analysisParagraph>As adopted by section 1461 of the Dodd-Frank Act, TILA section 129D(c)(4) provides that, to qualify for the exemption, a creditor must meet any other criteria established by the Bureau consistent with the provisions of TILA. The Board's proposed § 226.45(b)(2)(iii)(C) would have required that, to obtain the exemption, the creditor and its affiliates not maintain an escrow account for any mortgage they currently service through at least such mortgage obligation's second installment due date. The Board used the second installment due date as a cutoff point because it recognized that a creditor may sometimes hold a mortgage obligation for a short period after consummation to take steps necessary before transferring and assigning the mortgage debt obligation to the intended investor. The Board recognized that the process of transferring and assigning the mortgage obligation could extend beyond the mortgage obligation's first payment due date, especially when the first payment is due shortly after consummation.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Board believed this additional condition was necessary to effectuate the purpose of the exemption. The Board reasoned that, if a creditor already establishes and maintains escrow accounts, it has the capacity to escrow and therefore has no need for the exemption. Moreover, the Board concluded that a creditor's capacity to escrow should reflect not only its own activities but those of any affiliate because it assumed that a creditor could rely on its affiliate to help meet the escrow requirement. The Board sought comment, however, on three aspects: first, whether affiliates' capacities to escrow should be considered; second, whether the second payment due date is the appropriate cutoff point for whether a creditor has established an escrow account for purposes of the exemption; and third, whether the proposal should allow some <em data-original="E-03">de minimis</em> number of mortgage obligations for which escrows are maintained and, if so, what that number should be.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Six trade association commenters, five industry commenters and a Federal agency submitted comments noting that many creditors had only begun to establish escrow accounts for mortgage transactions after the Board adopted the 2008 HOEPA Final Rule, which took effect for most transactions in April 2010. Many of the same commenters argued that it would be unfair to deny the exemption in TILA section 129D(c) to those creditors that established escrow accounts only to comply with the current escrow requirements. Two trade association commenters and one industry commenter suggested a <em data-original="E-03">de minimis</em> number of mortgage obligations ranging from 10 to 50 mortgage obligations to address the exclusion of creditors currently escrowing that would otherwise qualify for the exemption. In addition, one industry commenter suggested that a creditor that establishes escrow accounts for distressed mortgage obligations should still be eligible for the exemption, as these creditors are doing so as an accommodation to the consumer to attempt to avoid foreclosure. No comments were received as to whether the second payment due date is the appropriate cutoff point for whether a creditor has established an escrow account for purposes of the exemption.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting the Board's proposal in § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D), with the addition of two exceptions based on comments received. The Bureau agrees with the Board generally that creditors that currently provide escrow accounts can afford to establish and maintain escrow accounts for higher-priced mortgage loans. Thus, to qualify for the exemption, a creditor and its affiliates must not maintain escrow accounts for any extensions of consumer credit secured by real property or a dwelling that the creditor, or its affiliates, currently services through at least the second installment due date. However, the Bureau agrees with commenters that those creditors that would otherwise qualify for the exemption but for their compliance with the current regulation, and creditors that establish escrow accounts as an accommodation to distressed consumers, should still be able to qualify for the exemption in TILA section 129D(c). In particular, the Bureau notes that Congress's decision to codify and expand upon the escrow requirement from the 2008 HOEPA Final Rule while simultaneously providing authority to exempt certain mortgage transactions by creditors operating predominantly in rural or underserved areas suggests that Congress intended to provide relief to creditors that were struggling to meet the existing requirements. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) and (<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) to provide exceptions to the exemption's general prerequisite that a creditor and its affiliates not maintain an escrow account.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Comment 35(b)(2)(iii)-1.iv clarifies that the limitation excluding creditors and their affiliates who currently maintain escrow accounts for other mortgage obligations they service applies only to mortgage obligations serviced at the time a transaction purporting to invoke the escrows exemption is consummated. Thus, the exemption still could apply even if the creditor or its affiliates previously established and maintained escrows for mortgage obligations it no longer services. However, if a creditor or an affiliate escrows for mortgage obligations currently serviced, those institutions are ineligible to invoke the escrows exemption until the escrow accounts are no longer maintained. The comment also clarifies that a creditor or its affiliate “maintains” an escrow account for a mortgage obligation only if it services the mortgage obligation at least through the due date of the second periodic payment under the terms of the legal obligation.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Comment 35(b)(2)(iii)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>)-1 clarifies that escrow accounts created by a creditor and its affiliates established between April 1, 2010, and June 1, 2013 are not counted for purposes of § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D). In addition, the comment clarifies that creditors that continue to maintain escrow accounts that were established between April 1, 2010, and June 1, 2013 until the termination of those escrow accounts will still qualify for the exemption, so long as they or their affiliates do not establish escrow accounts for other mortgage obligations that the creditor and its affiliates service after June 1, 2013 and they otherwise qualify under § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii). Comment 35(b)(2)(iii)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>)-1 clarifies that escrow accounts established after consummation for distressed consumers are not considered to be maintaining escrow accounts for purposes of § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D), although creditors that establish escrow accounts after consummation as a regular business practice are considered to be maintaining escrow accounts and cannot qualify for the exception under  § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) <em data-original="E-03">.</em>

              <title>Total Annual Mortgage Originations</title>
              <analysisParagraph>TILA section 129D(c)(3) provides that, to qualify for the exemption, a creditor together with its affiliates must have total annual mortgage originations that do not exceed a limit set by the Bureau. The Board's proposed § 226.45(b)(2)(iii)(B) required that the creditor and its affiliates, during either of the preceding two calendar years, have originated and retained servicing rights to 100 or fewer mortgage obligations secured by a first lien on real property or a dwelling. Although the Dodd-Frank Act requirement to establish escrow accounts applies only to higher-priced mortgage loans that are secured by first liens, the Board reasoned that it was appropriate to base the threshold on all first-lien originations because creditors are free to establish escrow accounts for all of their first-lien mortgages voluntarily to achieve the scale necessary to escrow cost-effectively. The Board estimated that a minimum servicing portfolio size of 500 is necessary to escrow cost-effectively, and assumed that the average life expectancy of a mortgage loan is about five years. Based on this reasoning, the Board believed that creditors would no longer need the benefit of the exemption if they originated and serviced more than 100 first-lien transactions per year. In contrast, the Board did not propose a specific annual originations threshold in connection with the balloon-payment qualified mortgages, but rather sought comment on whether to adopt a threshold based on the number of transactions or dollar volume and what numeric threshold would be appropriate.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In connection with the Board's 2011 Escrows Proposal, trade association and industry commenters generally said that the proposed maximum annual volume of originations would be insufficient to make the escrow accounts cost effective for creditors. No commenters provided information to support their suggestions for alternative thresholds or to refute the Board's analysis that creditors can provide escrow accounts cost-effectively when they annually originate and retain servicing rights to more than 100 mortgage obligations secured by a first lien on real property or a dwelling. Suggestions for higher thresholds ranged from 200 to 1,000 mortgage obligations per year originated and serviced. One consumer advocacy commenter suggested the proposed threshold was too high because it counted only first-lien mortgage transactions, instead of all mortgage obligations, but offered no specific alternative amount. Two industry commenters also suggested that the origination limit should measure only the number of higher-priced mortgage loans originated and serviced by the creditor and its affiliates.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In response to the Board's 2011 ATR Proposal, two trade associations and one group of State bank regulators, argued that other criteria, such as the asset-size limit or portfolio requirement, were sufficient and that neither a volume nor a total annual originations limit would be necessary. One industry trade association suggested combining the proposed alternatives and permitting creditors to elect under which limit they would operate. Other trade group and industry commenters indicated that the total annual originations limit would be preferable because of the varying dollar amount of transactions originated, which would constrain the number of consumers with limited credit options who could obtain balloon-payment mortgages in rural or underserved areas. Four trade group and industry commenters suggested a range for the total annual originations limit of 250 to 1,000 transactions.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that the requirement of TILA section 129D(c)(2) reflects a recognition that larger creditors have the systems capability and operational scale to establish cost-efficient escrow accounts. Similarly, the Bureau believes the requirement of TILA section 129C(b)(2)(E)(iv)(II) reflects Congress's recognition that larger creditors who operate in rural or underserved areas should be able to make credit available without resorting to balloon-payment mortgages. In light of the strong concerns expressed in both rulemakings about the potential negative impacts on small creditors in rural and underserved areas, the Bureau conducted further analysis to try to determine the most appropriate thresholds, although it was significantly constrained by the fact that data are limited with regard to mortgage originations in rural and underserved areas generally and in particular with regard to originations of balloon-payment mortgages.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau started with the premise that it would be preferable to use the same annual originations threshold in both rules to reflect the consistent language in both statutory provisions focusing on total annual mortgage loan originations, to facilitate compliance by not requiring institutions to track multiple metrics and to promote consistent application of the two exemptions. This approach requires significant reconciliation between the two proposals, however, because the escrows proposal focused specifically on transactions originated and serviced to gauge creditors' ability to maintain escrow accounts over time, while retention of servicing is not directly relevant to the balloon-payment qualified mortgage. However, to the extent that creditors chose to offer balloon-payment mortgages to manage their interest rate risk without having to undertake the compliance burdens involved in administering adjustable rate mortgages over time, the Bureau believes that both provisions are focused in a broad sense on accommodating creditors whose systems constraints might otherwise cause them to exit the market.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>With this in mind, the Bureau ultimately decided to adopt a threshold of 500 or fewer annual originations of first-lien transactions for both rules. The Bureau believes that this threshold will provide greater flexibility and reduce concerns that the specific threshold that had been proposed in the Board's 2011 Escrows Proposal (100 higher-priced mortgage loans originated and serviced annually in either of the preceding two years) would reduce access to credit by excluding creditors that need special accommodations in light of their capacity constraints. At the same time, the increase is not as dramatic as it may first appear because the Bureau's analysis of HMDA data suggests that even small creditors are likely to sell a significant number of their originations in the secondary market. Assuming that most mortgage transactions that are retained in portfolio are also serviced in house, the Bureau estimates that a creditor originating no more than 500 first-lien transactions per year would maintain and service a portfolio of about 670 mortgage obligations over time, assuming an average obligation life expectancy of five years.<footnote ref="33">A review of 2011 HMDA data shows creditors that otherwise meet the criteria of § 1026.43(f)(1)(vi) and originate between 200 and 500 or fewer first-lien covered transactions per year average 134 transactions per year retained in portfolio. Over a five year period, the total portfolio for these creditors would average 670 mortgage obligations.</footnote>
            Thus, the higher threshold will help to ensure that creditors that are subject to the escrow requirement do in fact maintain portfolios of sufficient size to maintain the escrow accounts on a cost efficient basis over time, in the event that the Board's estimate of a minimum portfolio of 500 transactions was too low. However, the Bureau believes that the 500 annual originations threshold in combination with the other requirements will still ensure that the balloon-payment qualified mortgage and escrow exemptions are available only to small creditors that focus primarily on a relationship-lending model and face significant systems constraints.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also believes that it is appropriate to focus the annual originations threshold on all first-lien originations. Given that escrow accounts are typically not maintained for transactions secured by subordinate liens, the Bureau does not believe that it makes sense to count such transactions toward the threshold because they would not contribute to a creditor's ability to achieve cost-efficiency. At the same time, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to count all first-lien transactions toward the threshold because creditors can voluntarily establish escrow accounts for such transactions to increase the cost-effectiveness of their program even though the mandatory account requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act apply only to first-lien, higher-priced mortgage loans. Focusing on all first-lien originations also provides a metric that is useful for gauging the relative scale of creditors' operations for purposes of the balloon-payment qualified mortgages, while focusing solely on the number of higher-priced mortgage loan originations would not. Accordingly, the Bureau adopts § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(B) requiring to creditor and its affiliates to have originated 500 or fewer covered transactions secured by a first lien.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>Asset-Size Threshold</title>
              <analysisParagraph>TILA section 129D(c)(4) provides that, to qualify for the exemption, a creditor must meet any asset-size threshold established by the Bureau. The Board's 2011 Escrows Proposal did not establish an asset-size threshold but did request comment on whether one should be added and, if so, what threshold level would be appropriate. In contrast, the Board proposed a $2 billion threshold for the balloon qualified mortgage exception. This number was based on the limited data available to the Board at the time of the proposal. Based on that limited information, the Board reasoned that none of the entities it identified as operating predominantly in rural or underserved areas had total assets as of the end of 2009 greater than $2 billion, and therefore, the limitation should be set at $2 billion. The Board expressly proposed setting the asset-size threshold at the highest level currently held by any of the institutions that appear to be smaller institutions that served areas with otherwise limited credit options.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In response to the Board's 2011 Escrows Proposal, a group of State bank regulators and a trade association advocated including an asset-size prerequisite in the exemption. The group of State bank regulators suggested that the asset-size prerequisite be the sole requirement to obtain the exemption but did not propose a specific dollar threshold. The industry commenter suggested the asset-size be $1 billion in assets, but did not provide a rationale for the amount.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Based on the Board's 2011 ATR Proposal, one group of State bank regulators suggested that the asset-size threshold be included and be the only requirement for a creditor to qualify for the balloon-mortgage qualified mortgage exemption. Two trade association commenters suggested that a $2 billion asset-size threshold was appropriate, with one also suggesting that the asset-size threshold be the only requirement for a creditor to qualify for the balloon-payment qualified mortgage exemption. One industry commenter suggested that the asset-size threshold be $10 billion.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>For reasons discussed above, the Bureau is adopting an annual originations limit as contemplated by the statute. Given that limitation, restricting the asset size of institutions that can claim the exemption is of limited importance. Nonetheless, the Bureau believes that an asset-size limitation is still helpful because very large institutions should have sufficient resources to adapt their systems to make mortgages without a balloon payment and to establish and maintain escrow accounts even if the scale of their mortgage operations is relatively modest. A very large institution with a relatively modest mortgage operation also does not have the same type of reputational and balance-sheet incentives to maintain the same kind of relationship-banking model as a smaller community-based creditor. An asset-size limitation can guard against circumvention of the rule if a larger institution were to elect to enter a rural area to make a limited number of higher-priced mortgage loans or balloon-payment mortgages. Therefore, the Bureau believes that the $2 billion asset limitation proposed by the Board in the Board's 2011 ATR Proposal remains an appropriate limitation and should be adopted in both this final rule and the 2013 ATR Final Rule.<footnote ref="34">The $2 billion threshold reflects the purposes of the exemption and the structure of the mortgage servicing industry. The Bureau's choice of $2 billion in assets as a threshold for purposes of TILA section 129D(c)(4) does not imply that a threshold of that type or of that magnitude would be an appropriate way to distinguish small firms for other purposes or in other industries.</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, the Bureau adopts § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(C) to require creditors to have total assets as of the end of the preceding calendar year that are less than $2 billion and is effectively adopting the same threshold by cross-reference to § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) for purposes of the balloon-payment qualified mortgage exemption in the 2013 ATR Final Rule. As provided in § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(C), this threshold dollar amount will adjust automatically each year based on the year-to-year change in the average of the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), not seasonally adjusted, for each 12-month period ending in November, with rounding to the nearest million dollars. Comment 35(b)(2)(iii)-1.iii recites this initial threshold and further clarifies that a creditor that had total assets below the threshold on December 31 of the preceding year satisfies this criterion for purposes of the exemption during the current calendar year. The comment also notes that the Bureau will publish notice of each year's asset threshold by amending the comment.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>“Operates Predominantly in Rural or Underserved Areas”</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Under TILA section 129D(c)(1), to qualify for the exemption, a creditor must “operate predominantly in rural or underserved areas.” The Board's 2011 Escrows Proposal would have required a creditor to have made during the preceding calendar year more than 50 percent of its first-lien higher-priced mortgage loans in “rural or underserved” counties. One industry commenter agreed with the Board's proposal. Numerous commenters to the Board's proposal in this rule and the Board's 2011 ATR Proposal objected to the proposed definition of “rural or undeserved” as discussed below, but commenters did not generally dispute the definition of “predominantly” as meaning more than 50 percent of originations of its first-lien higher-priced mortgage loans in rural or underserved counties.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes Congress enacted the exemption in TILA section 129D(c)(1) to ensure access to credit in rural and underserved areas where consumers may be able to obtain credit only from community banks or other small creditors serving those areas. The “operates predominantly in” requirement serves to limit the exemption to these institutions. To remove this portion of the qualifications of the creditor would be to circumvent Congress's stated requirement that the exemption was intended for creditors operating predominantly in rural or underserved areas. The Bureau believes that “predominantly” indicates a portion greater than half, hence the regulatory requirement of more than 50 percent.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Upon further analysis of the differences in the proposals for the escrows exemption and the balloon-payment qualified mortgage provisions, however, the Bureau believes that further harmonization between the two sets of requirements is warranted. The Board's 2011 Escrows Proposal would have required creditors to track first-lien higher-priced mortgage loans by county, while the qualified mortgage proposal would have required creditors to track balloon-payment mortgages. Given that the underlying statutory language regarding “operates predominantly” is the same in each instance and that tracking each type of mortgage separately would increase administrative burden, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to base the threshold for both rules on the distribution of all first-lien “covered transactions” as defined in § 1026.43(b)(1). As provided in the 2013 ATR Final Rule, a covered transaction is defined in § 1026.43(b)(1) as a consumer credit transaction that is secured by a dwelling, as defined in § 1026.2(a)(19), other than a transaction exempt from coverage under § 1026.43(a). The Bureau believes that counting only first-lien transactions will facilitate compliance, as well as promote consistency in applying to creditors the two exemptions under both rulemakings, since both exemptions relate to first-lien transactions. Balloon-payment mortgages that will meet the qualifications of the balloon-payment qualified mortgage exemption will be first-lien covered transactions, as having subordinate financing along with the balloon-payment mortgage would be rare since it further constrains a consumers' ability to build equity in the property and to refinance the balloon-payment mortgage when it becomes due. Subordinate-lien, higher-priced mortgage loans are not required to establish escrow accounts, as only first-lien higher priced mortgage loans must establish escrow accounts under § 1026.35(b)(1).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(A) provides that, during the preceding calendar year, a creditor must have made more than 50 percent of its total first-lien covered transactions in counties designated “rural” or “underserved” as defined by § 1026.35(b)(2)(iv), discussed below. Comment 35(b)(2)(iii)-1.i states that the Bureau publishes annually a list of counties that qualify as rural or underserved.</analysisParagraph>

            <analysisParagraph>In the 2011 Escrows Proposal, the Board proposed a new § 226.19(f) to implement the account disclosure requirements of TILA section 129D, as enacted by Sections 1461 and 1462 of the Dodd- Frank Act. Proposed § 226.19(f)<footnote ref="24">This section-by-section analysis discusses the Board's 2011 Escrows Proposal by reference to the Board's Regulation Z, 12 CFR part 226, which the Board proposed to amend, and discusses this final rule by reference to the Bureau's Regulation Z, 12 CFR part 1026, which this final rule amends.</footnote>

            would have required disclosures for the establishment or non-establishment of an escrow account in connection with consummation of a transaction secured by a first lien, but not a subordinate lien.

                <title>“Operates Predominantly in Rural or Underserved Areas”</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Under TILA section 129D(c)(1), to qualify for the exemption, a creditor must “operate predominantly in rural or underserved areas.” The Board's 2011 Escrows Proposal would have required a creditor to have made during the preceding calendar year more than 50 percent of its first-lien higher-priced mortgage loans in “rural or underserved” counties. One industry commenter agreed with the Board's proposal. Numerous commenters to the Board's proposal in this rule and the Board's 2011 ATR Proposal objected to the proposed definition of “rural or undeserved” as discussed below, but commenters did not generally dispute the definition of “predominantly” as meaning more than 50 percent of originations of its first-lien higher-priced mortgage loans in rural or underserved counties.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes Congress enacted the exemption in TILA section 129D(c)(1) to ensure access to credit in rural and underserved areas where consumers may be able to obtain credit only from community banks or other small creditors serving those areas. The “operates predominantly in” requirement serves to limit the exemption to these institutions. To remove this portion of the qualifications of the creditor would be to circumvent Congress's stated requirement that the exemption was intended for creditors operating predominantly in rural or underserved areas. The Bureau believes that “predominantly” indicates a portion greater than half, hence the regulatory requirement of more than 50 percent.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Upon further analysis of the differences in the proposals for the escrows exemption and the balloon-payment qualified mortgage provisions, however, the Bureau believes that further harmonization between the two sets of requirements is warranted. The Board's 2011 Escrows Proposal would have required creditors to track first-lien higher-priced mortgage loans by county, while the qualified mortgage proposal would have required creditors to track balloon-payment mortgages. Given that the underlying statutory language regarding “operates predominantly” is the same in each instance and that tracking each type of mortgage separately would increase administrative burden, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to base the threshold for both rules on the distribution of all first-lien “covered transactions” as defined in § 1026.43(b)(1). As provided in the 2013 ATR Final Rule, a covered transaction is defined in § 1026.43(b)(1) as a consumer credit transaction that is secured by a dwelling, as defined in § 1026.2(a)(19), other than a transaction exempt from coverage under § 1026.43(a). The Bureau believes that counting only first-lien transactions will facilitate compliance, as well as promote consistency in applying to creditors the two exemptions under both rulemakings, since both exemptions relate to first-lien transactions. Balloon-payment mortgages that will meet the qualifications of the balloon-payment qualified mortgage exemption will be first-lien covered transactions, as having subordinate financing along with the balloon-payment mortgage would be rare since it further constrains a consumers' ability to build equity in the property and to refinance the balloon-payment mortgage when it becomes due. Subordinate-lien, higher-priced mortgage loans are not required to establish escrow accounts, as only first-lien higher priced mortgage loans must establish escrow accounts under § 1026.35(b)(1).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(A) provides that, during the preceding calendar year, a creditor must have made more than 50 percent of its total first-lien covered transactions in counties designated “rural” or “underserved” as defined by § 1026.35(b)(2)(iv), discussed below. Comment 35(b)(2)(iii)-1.i states that the Bureau publishes annually a list of counties that qualify as rural or underserved.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>Total Annual Mortgage Originations</title>
                <analysisParagraph>TILA section 129D(c)(3) provides that, to qualify for the exemption, a creditor together with its affiliates must have total annual mortgage originations that do not exceed a limit set by the Bureau. The Board's proposed § 226.45(b)(2)(iii)(B) required that the creditor and its affiliates, during either of the preceding two calendar years, have originated and retained servicing rights to 100 or fewer mortgage obligations secured by a first lien on real property or a dwelling. Although the Dodd-Frank Act requirement to establish escrow accounts applies only to higher-priced mortgage loans that are secured by first liens, the Board reasoned that it was appropriate to base the threshold on all first-lien originations because creditors are free to establish escrow accounts for all of their first-lien mortgages voluntarily to achieve the scale necessary to escrow cost-effectively. The Board estimated that a minimum servicing portfolio size of 500 is necessary to escrow cost-effectively, and assumed that the average life expectancy of a mortgage loan is about five years. Based on this reasoning, the Board believed that creditors would no longer need the benefit of the exemption if they originated and serviced more than 100 first-lien transactions per year. In contrast, the Board did not propose a specific annual originations threshold in connection with the balloon-payment qualified mortgages, but rather sought comment on whether to adopt a threshold based on the number of transactions or dollar volume and what numeric threshold would be appropriate.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In connection with the Board's 2011 Escrows Proposal, trade association and industry commenters generally said that the proposed maximum annual volume of originations would be insufficient to make the escrow accounts cost effective for creditors. No commenters provided information to support their suggestions for alternative thresholds or to refute the Board's analysis that creditors can provide escrow accounts cost-effectively when they annually originate and retain servicing rights to more than 100 mortgage obligations secured by a first lien on real property or a dwelling. Suggestions for higher thresholds ranged from 200 to 1,000 mortgage obligations per year originated and serviced. One consumer advocacy commenter suggested the proposed threshold was too high because it counted only first-lien mortgage transactions, instead of all mortgage obligations, but offered no specific alternative amount. Two industry commenters also suggested that the origination limit should measure only the number of higher-priced mortgage loans originated and serviced by the creditor and its affiliates.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In response to the Board's 2011 ATR Proposal, two trade associations and one group of State bank regulators, argued that other criteria, such as the asset-size limit or portfolio requirement, were sufficient and that neither a volume nor a total annual originations limit would be necessary. One industry trade association suggested combining the proposed alternatives and permitting creditors to elect under which limit they would operate. Other trade group and industry commenters indicated that the total annual originations limit would be preferable because of the varying dollar amount of transactions originated, which would constrain the number of consumers with limited credit options who could obtain balloon-payment mortgages in rural or underserved areas. Four trade group and industry commenters suggested a range for the total annual originations limit of 250 to 1,000 transactions.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that the requirement of TILA section 129D(c)(2) reflects a recognition that larger creditors have the systems capability and operational scale to establish cost-efficient escrow accounts. Similarly, the Bureau believes the requirement of TILA section 129C(b)(2)(E)(iv)(II) reflects Congress's recognition that larger creditors who operate in rural or underserved areas should be able to make credit available without resorting to balloon-payment mortgages. In light of the strong concerns expressed in both rulemakings about the potential negative impacts on small creditors in rural and underserved areas, the Bureau conducted further analysis to try to determine the most appropriate thresholds, although it was significantly constrained by the fact that data are limited with regard to mortgage originations in rural and underserved areas generally and in particular with regard to originations of balloon-payment mortgages.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau started with the premise that it would be preferable to use the same annual originations threshold in both rules to reflect the consistent language in both statutory provisions focusing on total annual mortgage loan originations, to facilitate compliance by not requiring institutions to track multiple metrics and to promote consistent application of the two exemptions. This approach requires significant reconciliation between the two proposals, however, because the escrows proposal focused specifically on transactions originated and serviced to gauge creditors' ability to maintain escrow accounts over time, while retention of servicing is not directly relevant to the balloon-payment qualified mortgage. However, to the extent that creditors chose to offer balloon-payment mortgages to manage their interest rate risk without having to undertake the compliance burdens involved in administering adjustable rate mortgages over time, the Bureau believes that both provisions are focused in a broad sense on accommodating creditors whose systems constraints might otherwise cause them to exit the market.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>With this in mind, the Bureau ultimately decided to adopt a threshold of 500 or fewer annual originations of first-lien transactions for both rules. The Bureau believes that this threshold will provide greater flexibility and reduce concerns that the specific threshold that had been proposed in the Board's 2011 Escrows Proposal (100 higher-priced mortgage loans originated and serviced annually in either of the preceding two years) would reduce access to credit by excluding creditors that need special accommodations in light of their capacity constraints. At the same time, the increase is not as dramatic as it may first appear because the Bureau's analysis of HMDA data suggests that even small creditors are likely to sell a significant number of their originations in the secondary market. Assuming that most mortgage transactions that are retained in portfolio are also serviced in house, the Bureau estimates that a creditor originating no more than 500 first-lien transactions per year would maintain and service a portfolio of about 670 mortgage obligations over time, assuming an average obligation life expectancy of five years.<footnote ref="33">A review of 2011 HMDA data shows creditors that otherwise meet the criteria of § 1026.43(f)(1)(vi) and originate between 200 and 500 or fewer first-lien covered transactions per year average 134 transactions per year retained in portfolio. Over a five year period, the total portfolio for these creditors would average 670 mortgage obligations.</footnote>
            Thus, the higher threshold will help to ensure that creditors that are subject to the escrow requirement do in fact maintain portfolios of sufficient size to maintain the escrow accounts on a cost efficient basis over time, in the event that the Board's estimate of a minimum portfolio of 500 transactions was too low. However, the Bureau believes that the 500 annual originations threshold in combination with the other requirements will still ensure that the balloon-payment qualified mortgage and escrow exemptions are available only to small creditors that focus primarily on a relationship-lending model and face significant systems constraints.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also believes that it is appropriate to focus the annual originations threshold on all first-lien originations. Given that escrow accounts are typically not maintained for transactions secured by subordinate liens, the Bureau does not believe that it makes sense to count such transactions toward the threshold because they would not contribute to a creditor's ability to achieve cost-efficiency. At the same time, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to count all first-lien transactions toward the threshold because creditors can voluntarily establish escrow accounts for such transactions to increase the cost-effectiveness of their program even though the mandatory account requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act apply only to first-lien, higher-priced mortgage loans. Focusing on all first-lien originations also provides a metric that is useful for gauging the relative scale of creditors' operations for purposes of the balloon-payment qualified mortgages, while focusing solely on the number of higher-priced mortgage loan originations would not. Accordingly, the Bureau adopts § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(B) requiring to creditor and its affiliates to have originated 500 or fewer covered transactions secured by a first lien.</analysisParagraph>

                <analysisParagraph>TILA section 129D(c)(4) provides that, to qualify for the exemption, a creditor must meet any asset-size threshold established by the Bureau. The Board's 2011 Escrows Proposal did not establish an asset-size threshold but did request comment on whether one should be added and, if so, what threshold level would be appropriate. In contrast, the Board proposed a $2 billion threshold for the balloon qualified mortgage exception. This number was based on the limited data available to the Board at the time of the proposal. Based on that limited information, the Board reasoned that none of the entities it identified as operating predominantly in rural or underserved areas had total assets as of the end of 2009 greater than $2 billion, and therefore, the limitation should be set at $2 billion. The Board expressly proposed setting the asset-size threshold at the highest level currently held by any of the institutions that appear to be smaller institutions that served areas with otherwise limited credit options.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In response to the Board's 2011 Escrows Proposal, a group of State bank regulators and a trade association advocated including an asset-size prerequisite in the exemption. The group of State bank regulators suggested that the asset-size prerequisite be the sole requirement to obtain the exemption but did not propose a specific dollar threshold. The industry commenter suggested the asset-size be $1 billion in assets, but did not provide a rationale for the amount.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Based on the Board's 2011 ATR Proposal, one group of State bank regulators suggested that the asset-size threshold be included and be the only requirement for a creditor to qualify for the balloon-mortgage qualified mortgage exemption. Two trade association commenters suggested that a $2 billion asset-size threshold was appropriate, with one also suggesting that the asset-size threshold be the only requirement for a creditor to qualify for the balloon-payment qualified mortgage exemption. One industry commenter suggested that the asset-size threshold be $10 billion.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>For reasons discussed above, the Bureau is adopting an annual originations limit as contemplated by the statute. Given that limitation, restricting the asset size of institutions that can claim the exemption is of limited importance. Nonetheless, the Bureau believes that an asset-size limitation is still helpful because very large institutions should have sufficient resources to adapt their systems to make mortgages without a balloon payment and to establish and maintain escrow accounts even if the scale of their mortgage operations is relatively modest. A very large institution with a relatively modest mortgage operation also does not have the same type of reputational and balance-sheet incentives to maintain the same kind of relationship-banking model as a smaller community-based creditor. An asset-size limitation can guard against circumvention of the rule if a larger institution were to elect to enter a rural area to make a limited number of higher-priced mortgage loans or balloon-payment mortgages. Therefore, the Bureau believes that the $2 billion asset limitation proposed by the Board in the Board's 2011 ATR Proposal remains an appropriate limitation and should be adopted in both this final rule and the 2013 ATR Final Rule.<footnote ref="34">The $2 billion threshold reflects the purposes of the exemption and the structure of the mortgage servicing industry. The Bureau's choice of $2 billion in assets as a threshold for purposes of TILA section 129D(c)(4) does not imply that a threshold of that type or of that magnitude would be an appropriate way to distinguish small firms for other purposes or in other industries.</footnote>

                <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, the Bureau adopts § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(C) to require creditors to have total assets as of the end of the preceding calendar year that are less than $2 billion and is effectively adopting the same threshold by cross-reference to § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) for purposes of the balloon-payment qualified mortgage exemption in the 2013 ATR Final Rule. As provided in § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(C), this threshold dollar amount will adjust automatically each year based on the year-to-year change in the average of the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), not seasonally adjusted, for each 12-month period ending in November, with rounding to the nearest million dollars. Comment 35(b)(2)(iii)-1.iii recites this initial threshold and further clarifies that a creditor that had total assets below the threshold on December 31 of the preceding year satisfies this criterion for purposes of the exemption during the current calendar year. The comment also notes that the Bureau will publish notice of each year's asset threshold by amending the comment.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>Creditor and Affiliates Do Not Maintain Escrows</title>
                <analysisParagraph>As adopted by section 1461 of the Dodd-Frank Act, TILA section 129D(c)(4) provides that, to qualify for the exemption, a creditor must meet any other criteria established by the Bureau consistent with the provisions of TILA. The Board's proposed § 226.45(b)(2)(iii)(C) would have required that, to obtain the exemption, the creditor and its affiliates not maintain an escrow account for any mortgage they currently service through at least such mortgage obligation's second installment due date. The Board used the second installment due date as a cutoff point because it recognized that a creditor may sometimes hold a mortgage obligation for a short period after consummation to take steps necessary before transferring and assigning the mortgage debt obligation to the intended investor. The Board recognized that the process of transferring and assigning the mortgage obligation could extend beyond the mortgage obligation's first payment due date, especially when the first payment is due shortly after consummation.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Board believed this additional condition was necessary to effectuate the purpose of the exemption. The Board reasoned that, if a creditor already establishes and maintains escrow accounts, it has the capacity to escrow and therefore has no need for the exemption. Moreover, the Board concluded that a creditor's capacity to escrow should reflect not only its own activities but those of any affiliate because it assumed that a creditor could rely on its affiliate to help meet the escrow requirement. The Board sought comment, however, on three aspects: first, whether affiliates' capacities to escrow should be considered; second, whether the second payment due date is the appropriate cutoff point for whether a creditor has established an escrow account for purposes of the exemption; and third, whether the proposal should allow some <em data-original="E-03">de minimis</em> number of mortgage obligations for which escrows are maintained and, if so, what that number should be.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Six trade association commenters, five industry commenters and a Federal agency submitted comments noting that many creditors had only begun to establish escrow accounts for mortgage transactions after the Board adopted the 2008 HOEPA Final Rule, which took effect for most transactions in April 2010. Many of the same commenters argued that it would be unfair to deny the exemption in TILA section 129D(c) to those creditors that established escrow accounts only to comply with the current escrow requirements. Two trade association commenters and one industry commenter suggested a <em data-original="E-03">de minimis</em> number of mortgage obligations ranging from 10 to 50 mortgage obligations to address the exclusion of creditors currently escrowing that would otherwise qualify for the exemption. In addition, one industry commenter suggested that a creditor that establishes escrow accounts for distressed mortgage obligations should still be eligible for the exemption, as these creditors are doing so as an accommodation to the consumer to attempt to avoid foreclosure. No comments were received as to whether the second payment due date is the appropriate cutoff point for whether a creditor has established an escrow account for purposes of the exemption.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting the Board's proposal in § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D), with the addition of two exceptions based on comments received. The Bureau agrees with the Board generally that creditors that currently provide escrow accounts can afford to establish and maintain escrow accounts for higher-priced mortgage loans. Thus, to qualify for the exemption, a creditor and its affiliates must not maintain escrow accounts for any extensions of consumer credit secured by real property or a dwelling that the creditor, or its affiliates, currently services through at least the second installment due date. However, the Bureau agrees with commenters that those creditors that would otherwise qualify for the exemption but for their compliance with the current regulation, and creditors that establish escrow accounts as an accommodation to distressed consumers, should still be able to qualify for the exemption in TILA section 129D(c). In particular, the Bureau notes that Congress's decision to codify and expand upon the escrow requirement from the 2008 HOEPA Final Rule while simultaneously providing authority to exempt certain mortgage transactions by creditors operating predominantly in rural or underserved areas suggests that Congress intended to provide relief to creditors that were struggling to meet the existing requirements. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) and (<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) to provide exceptions to the exemption's general prerequisite that a creditor and its affiliates not maintain an escrow account.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Comment 35(b)(2)(iii)-1.iv clarifies that the limitation excluding creditors and their affiliates who currently maintain escrow accounts for other mortgage obligations they service applies only to mortgage obligations serviced at the time a transaction purporting to invoke the escrows exemption is consummated. Thus, the exemption still could apply even if the creditor or its affiliates previously established and maintained escrows for mortgage obligations it no longer services. However, if a creditor or an affiliate escrows for mortgage obligations currently serviced, those institutions are ineligible to invoke the escrows exemption until the escrow accounts are no longer maintained. The comment also clarifies that a creditor or its affiliate “maintains” an escrow account for a mortgage obligation only if it services the mortgage obligation at least through the due date of the second periodic payment under the terms of the legal obligation.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Comment 35(b)(2)(iii)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>)-1 clarifies that escrow accounts created by a creditor and its affiliates established between April 1, 2010, and June 1, 2013 are not counted for purposes of § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D). In addition, the comment clarifies that creditors that continue to maintain escrow accounts that were established between April 1, 2010, and June 1, 2013 until the termination of those escrow accounts will still qualify for the exemption, so long as they or their affiliates do not establish escrow accounts for other mortgage obligations that the creditor and its affiliates service after June 1, 2013 and they otherwise qualify under § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii). Comment 35(b)(2)(iii)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>)-1 clarifies that escrow accounts established after consummation for distressed consumers are not considered to be maintaining escrow accounts for purposes of § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D), although creditors that establish escrow accounts after consummation as a regular business practice are considered to be maintaining escrow accounts and cannot qualify for the exception under  § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) <em data-original="E-03">.</em>

            <title>35(b)(2)(iii)</title>
            <analysisParagraph>As adopted by Dodd-Frank Act section 1461, TILA section 129D(c) authorizes the Bureau to exempt from the higher-priced mortgage loan escrow requirement a creditor that: (1) Operates predominantly in rural or underserved areas; (2) together with all affiliates, has total annual mortgage loan originations that do not exceed a limit set by the Bureau; (3) retains its mortgage obligations in portfolio; and (4) meets any asset-size threshold and any other criteria as the Bureau may establish. As discussed above, Dodd-Frank Act section 1412 ability-to-repay provisions contain a similar set of criteria with regard to certain balloon-payment mortgages originated and held in portfolio by creditors that operate predominantly in rural or underserved areas. The statute authorizes the Bureau to issue regulations permitting certain balloon-payment mortgages issued by the specified creditors to receive a presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay requirements as “qualified mortgages,” even though the general qualified mortgage criteria prohibit balloon-payment features. Specifically, in addition to having to meet certain transaction-specific features and underwriting requirements, balloon-payment qualified mortgages may be made only by a creditor that: (1) Operates predominantly in rural or underserved areas; (2) together with all affiliates, has total annual residential mortgage transaction originations that do not exceed a limit set by the Bureau; (3) retains the balloon-payment mortgages in portfolio; and (4) meets any asset-size threshold and any other criteria as the Bureau may establish. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> TILA section 129C(b)(2)(E), 15 U.S.C. 1639c(b)(2)(E).</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Board interpreted the two provisions as serving similar but not identical purposes, and thus varied certain aspects of the proposals to implement the balloon qualified mortgage and escrow provisions. Specifically, the Board interpreted the escrow provision as being designed to exempt creditors that do not possess economies of scale to offset cost-effectively the burden of establishing escrow accounts by maintaining a certain minimum portfolio size from being required to establish escrow accounts on higher-priced mortgage loans, and the balloon-payment qualified mortgage provision to ensure access to credit in rural and underserved areas where consumers may be able to obtain credit only from community banks offering balloon-payment mortgages. Accordingly, the two Board proposals would have used similar definitions of “rural” and “underserved,” but did not provide uniformity in calculating and defining various other elements. Specifically, the Board's proposed § 226.45(b)(2)(iii) would have implemented the escrow exemption in TILA section 129D(c) by requiring that the creditor have (1) in the prior year made more than 50 percent of its first-lien higher-priced mortgage loans in rural or underserved areas, (2) together with all affiliates, originated and retained servicing rights to no more than 100 first-lien mortgage obligations in either the current or prior calendar year, and (3) together with all affiliates, not maintained an escrow account on any consumer credit transaction secured by real property or a dwelling that is currently serviced by the creditor or its affiliates. The Board also sought comment on whether to add a requirement for the creditor to meet an asset-size limit and what that size should be.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In contrast, the Board's proposal for balloon qualified mortgages would have required that the creditor (1) in the preceding calendar year, have made more than 50 percent of its balloon-payment mortgages in rural or underserved areas; and (2) have assets that did not exceed $2 billion. The Board proposed two alternatives for qualifications relating to (1) the total annual originations limit; and (2) the retention of balloon-payment mortgages in portfolio.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In both cases, the Board proposed to use a narrow definition of rural based on the Economic Research Service (ERS) of the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) “urban influence codes” (UICs). The UICs are based on the definitions of “metropolitan” and “micropolitan” as developed by the Office of Management and Budget, along with other factors reviewed by the ERS that place counties into twelve separately defined UICs depending on the size of the largest city and town in the county. The Board's proposal would have limited the definition of rural to certain “non-core” counties, which are areas outside of any metropolitan or micropolitan area, excluding those adjacent to a metropolitan area of at least one million residents or adjacent to a micropolitan area with a town of at least 2,500 residents. This definition corresponded with UICs of 7, 10, 11, and 12, which would have covered areas in which only 2.3 percent of the nation's population lives.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In light of the overlap in criteria between the escrow exemption and balloon qualified mortgage provisions, the Bureau considered comments responding to both proposals in determining how to finalize the particular elements of each rule as discussed further below. With regard to exercising the Bureau's authority to create an escrows exemption in general, the bulk of the comments received asserted that the Bureau should exercise such authority but that the scope of the proposal was too limited and would lead to reduced access to credit or increased costs for consumers in rural areas because of increased compliance costs for creditors. Two industry commenters suggested a blanket exemption for community banks, but did not identify any criteria to define a community bank. Five industry commenters suggested the exemption should be based solely on loan-to-value ratio of the transaction being originated, ranging from 50 percent to 80 percent, without using any of the statutory requirements. Four trade association commenters suggested that the exemption should be based solely on whether the debt obligation was being kept in the creditor's portfolio. One consumer advocacy group stated that the exemption was too broad because, under its reading of section 1461 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the exemption was not meant to protect access to credit but, rather, to protect communities that need credit but cannot find credit with terms better than the terms of higher-priced mortgage loans.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that escrows generally provide meaningful consumer protections, as consumers may not incorporate recurring costs related to the ownership of a dwelling to their monthly mortgage payments to anticipate the total costs associated with the dwelling. For consumers who struggle with their monthly mortgage payments, there is a higher probability of foreclosure as a result. Based on recent research,<footnote ref="29">Nathan B. Anderson and Jane B. Dokko, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Liquidity Problems and Early Payment Default Among Subprime Mortgages,&lt;/em&gt; Finance and Economics Discussion Series, Federal Reserve Board (2011), available at: &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2011/201109/201109pap.pdf.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>
            consumers that do not have an escrow account in the first year after consummation result in 0.35 percent more foreclosures per year for first-lien, higher-priced mortgages. However, in rural and underserved areas where there are fewer creditors that may be willing to extend higher-priced mortgage loans, the number of providers could be further reduced when additional costs associated with establishing and maintaining escrow accounts are taken into account. The reduction in the number of providers could lead to some consumers being unable to obtain higher-priced mortgage loans, or to increase the costs of the higher-priced mortgage loans as a result of a concentrated market with limited competition to a point where the consumer would be unable to repay the higher-priced mortgage loan.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>There are also substantial data suggesting that the small portfolio creditors that are most likely to have difficulty maintaining escrow accounts (or to rely on balloon loan transactions to manage their interest rate risks) have a significantly better track record than larger creditors with regard to the performance of their mortgage transactions. As discussed in more depth in the 2013 ATR Concurrent Proposal, because small portfolio creditors retain a higher percentage of their transactions on their own books, they have strong incentives to engage in thorough underwriting. To minimize performance risk, small community creditors have developed underwriting standards that differ from those employed by larger institutions. Small creditors generally engage in “relationship banking,” in which underwriting decisions rely at least in part on qualitative information gained from personal relationships between creditors and consumers. This qualitative information focuses on subjective factors such as consumer character and reliability which “may be difficult to quantify, verify, and communicate through the normal transmission channels of banking organization.”<footnote ref="30">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Allen N. Berger and Gregory F. Udell, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Small Business Credit Availability and Relationship Lending: The Importance of Bank Organizational Structure,&lt;/em&gt; Economic Journal (2002).</footnote>
            While it is not possible to disaggregate the impact of each of the elements of the community banking model, the combined effect is highly beneficial. Moreover, where consumers have trouble paying their mortgage obligations, small portfolio creditors have stronger incentives to work with the consumers to get them back on track, to protect both the creditors' balance sheets and their reputations in their local communities. Market-wide data demonstrate that mortgage delinquency and charge-off rates are significantly lower at smaller banks than at larger banks.<footnote ref="31">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 2013 ATR Concurrent Proposal; FDIC, Community Banking Study, December 2012, available at: &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/resources/cbi/report/cbi-full.pdf.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that Congress carefully weighed these considerations in authorizing the Bureau to establish an exemption in TILA section 129D(c) to ensure access to credit in rural and underserved areas where consumers may be able to obtain credit only from community banks that cannot maintain escrow accounts on a cost-effective basis. Thus, the Bureau concludes that exercising its authority is appropriate, but also that the exemption should implement the statutory criteria to ensure it effectuates Congress's intent. Accordingly, as discussed in more detail below, the Bureau is adopting § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) largely as proposed, but with certain changes described below, to implement TILA section 129D(c).</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In particular, the Bureau has concluded that it is appropriate to make the specific creditor qualifications much more consistent between the balloon-payment qualified mortgage and escrow exemptions than originally proposed by the Board.<footnote ref="32">The Bureau has similarly attempted to maintain consistency between the asset-size limit, annual originations threshold, and requirements concerning portfolio transactions as between the final rules that it is adopting with regard to balloon qualified mortgages and the escrow exemption and its separate proposal to create a new type of qualified mortgage originated and held by small portfolio creditors. The Bureau is seeking comment in that proposal on these elements and on whether other adjustments are appropriate to the existing rules to maintain continuity and reduce compliance burden. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; the 2013 ATR Concurrent Proposal.</footnote>
            The Bureau believes that this approach is justified by several considerations, including the very similar statutory language, the similar congressional intents underlying the two provisions, and the fact that requiring small creditors operating predominantly in rural or underserved areas to track overlapping but not identical sets of technical criteria for each separate provision could create unwarranted compliance burden that itself would frustrate the intent of the statutes. Although the Bureau has recast and loosened some of the criteria to promote consistency, the Bureau has carefully calibrated the changes to further the purpose of each rulemaking. Further, the Bureau believes that any risk to consumers from the modifications is minimal given the nature of the small creditors' operations and in particular the fact that they are required to hold the affected transactions in portfolio (in this final rule's case, indirectly, by virtue of the requirement that a transaction originated under the escrow exemption not be subject to a forward commitment at consummation). As discussed in more detail below and in the 2013 ATR Concurrent Proposal, which also proposes to adopt several of the criteria to define a new type of qualified mortgage, the creditors at issue have strong motivations to provide vigorous underwriting and high levels of customer service to protect their balance sheets and reputations in their local communities. This motivation is manifest in the fact that they have demonstrably lower credit losses on their mortgage originations than larger institutions.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>For the foregoing reasons, the Bureau is adopting § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) to implement TILA section 129D(c) by providing that a transaction is exempt from the escrow account requirement otherwise applicable to a higher-priced mortgage loan if the creditor: (1) In the preceding calendar year made more than 50 percent of its first-lien covered transactions in counties designated by the Bureau as “rural” or “underserved”; (2) together with all affiliates extended 500 or fewer first-lien covered transactions in the preceding calendar year; and (3) has total assets that are less than $2 billion, adjusted annually for inflation. The final rule also creates greater parallelism with the balloon qualified mortgage provision with regard to the requirement that the affected transactions be held in portfolio by requiring in both rules that the transactions not be subject to a “forward commitment” agreement at the time of consummation. These qualifications and the other requirements under the final rule are discussed in more detail below.</analysisParagraph>

            <title>36(h) Prohibition on Mandatory Arbitration Clauses and Waivers of Certain Consumer Rights</title>
            <analysisParagraph>Section 1414 of the Dodd-Frank Act added TILA section 129C(e)(1), which prohibits a closed-end consumer credit transaction secured by a dwelling or an extension of open-end consumer credit secured by the consumer's principal dwelling from containing terms that require arbitration or any other non-judicial procedure as the method for resolving disputes arising out of the transaction. TILA section 129C(e)(2) provides that, subject to TILA section 129C(e)(3) a consumer and creditor or any assignee may nonetheless agree, after a dispute arises, to use arbitration or other non-judicial procedure to resolve the dispute. The statute further provides in section 129C(e)(3) that no covered transaction secured by a dwelling, and no related agreement between the consumer and creditor, may be applied or interpreted to bar a consumer from bringing a claim in court in connection with any alleged violation of Federal law.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed § 1026.36(h) to implement these statutory provisions, pursuant to TILA section 105(a) and section 1022(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act. Proposed § 1026.36(h)(2) would have clarified the interaction between TILA sections 129C(e)(2) and (e)(3), and the section-by-section analysis noted that TILA section 129C(e)(3) and § 1026.36(h)(2) do not address State law causes of action.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Commenters generally supported the proposal. Although some commenters addressed details of the substance of the proposal, many commenters addressed the timing of the provisions' implementation. For example, several consumer groups stated that the proposal did not make any substantive changes to the statutory provisions and should be withdrawn because there was no reason to delay the effective date of the statutory provisions. One commenter acknowledged that the provisions were mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act but urged the Bureau to encourage mandatory arbitration anyway. SBA Advocacy stated that some Small Entity Representatives did not understand why the provisions were being included in this rule and asked the Bureau to consider adopting it at a later date. A bank association commenter urged the Bureau to delay the provisions until after it completed its required general study of arbitration clauses in consumer transactions, pursuant to section 1028 of the Dodd-Frank Act.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>One commenter requested clarification on whether the provisions apply to waivers of rights to a jury trial. Other commenters questioned variously whether the proposal altered the statutory provisions: By applying the provision on waivers of causes of action to post-dispute agreements; by applying that provision to loans other than residential mortgage loans and open-end consumer credit plans secured by a principal dwelling; by limiting it to Federal causes of action; or by prohibiting mandatory arbitration clauses in contracts and agreements other than the note and agreements related to the note. One commenter stated that the applicability of the proposed rule provisions was confusing because the provisions refer to consumer transactions secured by a dwelling but their scope is also addressed separately in proposed § 1026.36(j). (Proposed § 1026.36(j) is finalized as § 1026.36(b) of the rule.) Finally, one commenter suggested that the statute and the rule would prohibit nonjudicial foreclosures and prevent a servicer from settling a dispute with a consumer through a settlement agreement.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The provisions on mandatory arbitration and waiver are contained in the Dodd-Frank Act. Absent action by the Bureau, they would take effect on January 21, 2013. The Bureau believes that it is necessary and appropriate to provide implementing language to facilitate compliance with the statute. At the same time, the Bureau recognizes the point made by several commenters regarding the importance of these consumer protections. The fact that the Bureau is implementing the provisions by regulation does not require the Bureau to delay the provisions' effective date for an extended period, as the commenters may have assumed. Instead, the Bureau is providing an effective date of June 1, 2013. The Bureau believes this effective date will give consumers the benefit of these statutory protections within a short timeframe, while also providing industry time to adjust its systems and practices. The Bureau does not believe that industry needs a longer period because the prohibitions on mandatory arbitration agreements and waivers of Federal claims have been known since the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted, and this final rule will not require extensive changes to origination systems. Furthermore, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac do not accept loans that require arbitration or other nonjudicial procedures to resolve disputes, so the Bureau believes this aspect of the statute and final rule will not necessitate significant changes to current practices in most circumstances. The Bureau is not providing that the provision become effective immediately, however, in order to provide industry a short period to make any needed adjustments.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In response to the comments, the Bureau does not interpret TILA section 129C(e)(3) to limit waivers of rights to a jury trial because bench trials are judicial procedures, not nonjudicial procedures. The Bureau does not interpret TILA section 129C(e)(1) to limit deeds of trust providing for nonjudicial foreclosure because such instruments are not agreements to use nonjudicial procedures to resolve controversies or settle claims arising out of the transaction, in contrast with agreements to use arbitration, mediation, and other forms of alternative dispute resolution. Nor does the Bureau interpret TILA section 129C(e)(3) to limit nonjudicial foreclosures because nonjudicial foreclosures still allow consumers to bring actions in court alleging violations of Federal law.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Similarly, the Bureau does not interpret the statute to bar settlement agreements. Such a result would be a highly unusual—perhaps unprecedented—prohibition, and the Bureau believes that Congress would have spoken expressly about settlement agreements if that was the result it intended.<footnote ref="157">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g., Robinson&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Shelby Cnty. Bd. of Educ.,&lt;/em&gt; 566 F.3d 642, 648 (6th Cir. 2009) (&amp;#8220;[I]t is also well-established that `[p]ublic policy strongly favors settlement of disputes without litigation. * * * Settlement agreements should therefore be upheld whenever equitable and policy considerations so permit.'&amp;#8221;).</footnote>
            Instead, the Bureau reads the statute to mean that if a consumer and creditor or assignee agree, after a dispute or claim arises, to settle the dispute or claim, the settlement agreement may be applied or interpreted to waive the consumer's right to bring that dispute or claim in court, even if it is a Federal law claim. Accordingly, the Bureau is revising the regulatory text to clarify that § 1026.36(h) does not limit a consumer and creditor or any assignee from agreeing, after a dispute or claim under the transaction arises, to settle that dispute or claim. Under TILA section 129C(e)(3) and § 1026.36(h)(2), however, no settlement agreement may be applied or interpreted to bar the consumer from bringing an action in court for any other alleged violation of Federal law.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is further revising the regulatory text to address the belief of some commenters that the Bureau had altered the scope of the statutory provision. As discussed above, TILA section 129C(e)(2) provides that the exception for post-dispute agreements from the prohibition on mandatory arbitration agreements is itself subject to the prohibition on waivers of rights to bring Federal causes of action in court. The proposal specified that a post-dispute agreement to use arbitration or other nonjudicial procedure could not limit the ability of the consumer to bring a covered claim through the agreed-upon procedure. This final rule clarifies that, consistent with the discussion of waivers of causes of action in settlement agreements above, the Bureau interprets the statute to mean that if a consumer and creditor or assignee agree, after a dispute or claim arises, to use arbitration or other nonjudicial procedure to resolve that dispute or claim, the agreement may be applied or interpreted to waive the consumer's right to bring <em data-original="E-03">that</em> dispute or claim in court, even if it is a Federal law claim. The Bureau believes that, in such an instance, the consumer is aware of the specific dispute or claim at issue and is therefore in a better position to make a knowing decision whether to resolve the dispute or claim without bringing an action in court. But no post-dispute agreement to use arbitration or other nonjudicial procedure may be applied or interpreted to bar the consumer from bringing an action in court for any other alleged violation of Federal law.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau disagrees with commenters who stated it had expanded the scope of TILA section 129C(e) to cover open-end consumer credit plans other than those secured by the principal dwelling of the consumer. Proposed § 1026.36(j) (implemented in this final rule as § 1026.36(b)) clarifies the scope of each of the other substantive paragraphs in § 1026.36 and provides that the only open-end consumer credit plans to which § 1026.36(h) applies are those secured by the principal dwelling of the consumer. However, to reduce uncertainty, the Bureau is including a statement in § 1026.36(h) that it is applicable to “a home equity line of credit secured by the consumer's principal dwelling.”</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also disagrees that the proposed language changed the scope of the prohibition on waivers of causes of action by including the word “Federal” in the paragraph (h)(2) heading, “No waivers of Federal statutory causes of action.” The contents of paragraph (h)(2) and the corresponding statutory paragraph (e)(3) both provide that the prohibition applies to alleged violations of Section 129C of TILA, any other provision of TILA, or any other Federal law. Thus, the scope of the statutory prohibition is limited to Federal law, and the implementing regulation is properly so limited.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau disagrees that the prohibition on agreements to use mandatory arbitration applies only to the note itself. TILA section 129C(e)(1) provides that it applies to the terms of a residential mortgage loan and to an extension of credit under an open-end consumer credit plan secured by the principal dwelling of the consumer. The terms of such transactions are frequently memorialized in multiple documents. Plainly, the prohibition cannot be evaded simply by including a provision for mandatory arbitration in a document other than the note if that document is executed as part of the transaction. The prohibition applies to the terms of the whole transaction, regardless of which particular document contains those terms. However, to prevent any misunderstanding that the prohibition applies to agreements that are not part of the credit transaction, the Bureau is replacing the phrase “contract or agreement in connection with a” consumer credit transaction with the phrase “contract or other agreement for” a consumer credit transaction.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>“Rural” and “Underserved” Defined</title>
              <analysisParagraph>As adopted in the Dodd-Frank Act, TILA section 129D(c)(1) requires, among other criteria for the escrows exemption, that the creditor operate predominantly in “rural” and “underserved” areas, but does not define either term. As discussed above, the Board proposed separate definitions for “rural” and “underserved,” respectively, in both the Board's 2011 Escrows Proposal and the 2011 ATR Proposal, and the definitions for the two terms were similar across the two proposals.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Commenters on the two proposals addressed the specific definitions themselves but not the necessity of creating a definition for “rural” that is separate from “underserved.” The Bureau is adopting the Board's approach in § 1026.35(b)(2)(iv) which establishes a definition of rural that is separate from underserved. Thus, creditors' activity in either type of area will count toward their eligibility for the escrows exemption and for making balloon-payment qualified mortgages.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">“Rural.”</em> As described above, the Board's proposed definition of rural for purposes of both the balloon-payment qualified mortgage and escrows exemptions would have relied upon the ERS's “urban influence codes” (UICs), which in turn are based on the definitions of “metropolitan statistical area” and “micropolitan statistical area.”<footnote ref="35">The ERS places counties into twelve separately defined UICs depending on the size of the largest city or town in the county or in adjacent counties. Descriptions of UICs can be found on the ERS Web site at &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/urban-influence-codes/documentation.aspx.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>

            The Board's proposal would have limited the definition of rural to certain “non-core” counties, which are areas outside of any metropolitan or micropolitan area that are not adjacent to a metropolitan area with at least one million residents or to a micropolitan area with a town of at least 2,500 residents. This definition corresponded to UICs 7, 10, 11, and 12. The counties that would have been covered under the Board's proposed definition contain 2.3 percent of the United States population under the 2000 census. The Board believed this approach limited the definition of “rural” to those properties most likely to have only limited sources of mortgage credit because of their remoteness from urban centers and their resources. However, the Board sought comment on all aspects of this approach to defining rural, including whether the definition should be broader or narrower or based on information other than UIC codes.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Many commenters to both the 2011 ATR Proposal and the 2011 Escrows Proposal, including more than a dozen trade group commenters, several individual industry commenters, one association of State banking regulators, and a United States Senator, stated that the rural definition was too narrow. The trade association and industry commenters, and the group of State banking regulators, had various proposals to broaden the definition, from the addition of other UICs and a combination of county population and asset size to the adoption of other regulatory definitions of “rural,” such as those governing credit unions. The comment from a United States Senator suggested using the eligibility of a property to secure a single-family mortgage under the USDA's Rural Housing Loan program as the definition of a rural property.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees that a broader definition of “rural” is appropriate to ensure access to credit with regard to both the escrows and balloon-payment qualified mortgage exemptions. In particular, the Bureau believes that all “non-core” counties should be encompassed in the definition of rural, including counties adjacent to a metropolitan area of at least one million residents or a county with a town of at least 2,500 residents (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> counties with a UIC of 4, 6, or 9 in addition to the counties with the UICs included in the Board's definition). The Bureau also believes that micropolitan areas that are not adjacent to a metropolitan area should be included within the definition of rural (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> counties with a UIC of 8), as these areas are not located adjacent to metropolitan areas that are served by many creditors. These counties have significantly fewer creditors originating higher-priced mortgage loans and balloon-payment mortgages than other counties.<footnote ref="36">A review of data from HMDA reporters indicates that there were 700 creditors in 2011 that otherwise meet the requirements of new § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii), of which 391 originate higher-priced mortgage loans in counties that meet the definition of rural, compared to 2,110 creditors that otherwise meet the requirements of § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) that originate balloon-payment mortgages in counties that would not be rural. The 391 creditors originated 12,921 higher-priced mortgage loans, representing 30 percent of their 43,359 total mortgage loan originations. A review of data from credit unions indicates that there were 830 creditors in 2011 that otherwise meet the requirements of § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii), of which 415 originate balloon-payment and hybrid mortgages in counties that meet the definition of rural, compared to 3,551 creditors that otherwise meet the requirements of § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) that originate balloon-payment mortgages in counties that would not be rural. The 415 creditors originated 4,980 balloon-payment mortgage originations, representing 20 percent of their 24,968 total mortgage loan originations.</footnote>
            Including these counties within the definition of rural would result in 9.7 percent of the U.S. population being located within rural areas. Under this definition, only counties in metropolitan areas or in micropolitan areas adjacent to metropolitan areas would be excluded from the definition of rural.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also considered adopting the definition of rural used to determine the eligibility of a property to secure a single-family mortgage under the USDA's Rural Housing Loan program. This definition subdivides counties into rural and non-rural areas based upon whether certain areas are open country, or contain a town, village, city or place, with certain population criteria, and excludes areas associated with an urban area. Given the size of some counties, particularly in western States, this approach may provide a more nuanced measure of access to credit in some areas than a county-by-county metric. However, use of the Rural Housing Loan metrics would incorporate such significant portions of metropolitan and micropolitan counties that 37 percent of the United States population would be within areas defined as rural. Based on a review of HMDA data and the location of mortgage transactions originated by HMDA reporting entities, the average number of creditors in the areas that would meet the USDA's Rural Housing Loan program definition of rural is ten. The Bureau believes that a wholesale adoption of the Rural Housing Loan definitions would therefore expand the definition of rural beyond the intent of the escrow and balloon-payment qualified mortgage exemptions under sections 1412 and 1461 of the Dodd-Frank Act by incorporating areas in which there is robust access to credit.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, the final rule implements § 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A) to provide that a county is rural if it is neither in a metropolitan statistical area, nor in a micropolitan statistical area that is adjacent to a metropolitan statistical area. The Bureau intends to continue studying over time the possible selective use of the Rural Housing Loan program definitions and tools provided on the USDA Web site to determine whether a particular property is located within a “rural” area. For purposes of initial implementation, however, the Bureau believes that defining “rural” to include more UIC categories creates an appropriate balance to preserve access to credit and create a system that is easy for creditors to implement.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">“Underserved.”</em> The Board's proposed § 226.45(b)(2)(iv)(B) would have defined a county as “underserved” during a calendar year if no more than two creditors extend credit secured by a first lien on real property or a dwelling five or more times in that county. The definition was based on the Board's judgment that, where no more than two creditors are significantly active, the inability of one creditor to offer a higher-priced mortgage loan would be detrimental to consumers who would have limited credit options because only one creditor, or no creditors, would be left to provide the higher-priced mortgage loan. Essentially, a consumer who could only qualify for a higher-priced mortgage loan would be required to obtain credit from the remaining creditor in that area or would be left with no credit options at all. Most of the same commenters that stated that the proposed definition of rural was too narrow, as discussed above, also stated that this definition of underserved was too narrow. The commenters proposed various different standards, including standards that considered the extent to which the property was in a rural area, as an alternate definition of underserved.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with the Board that the purpose of the exemption is to permit creditors to continue to offer credit to consumers, rather than to refuse to make higher-priced mortgage loans if such creditors' withdrawal would significantly limit consumers' ability to obtain mortgage credit. In light of this rationale, the Bureau believes that “underserved” should be implemented in a way that protects consumers from losing meaningful access to mortgage credit and that it is appropriate to focus the definition on identifying areas where the withdrawal of a creditor from the market could leave no meaningful competition for consumers' mortgage business. The Bureau notes that the final rule's expanded definition of “rural,” as discussed above, will also address concerns about access to credit in many areas. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting § 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(B) to define a property as “underserved” if it is located in a county where no more than two creditors extend covered transactions secured by a first lien five or more times in that county during a calendar year, substantially consistent with the Board's proposal. As adopted, § 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(B) also expressly states that the numbers of creditors and of their originations in counties for purposes of this definition is as reported in HMDA data for the year in question.
          </analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau adopted this definition based on HMDA data to provide an objective, easily administered rule and one that is consistent with the purpose of preserving credit access in underserved areas. Given that many smaller creditors may not be subject to HMDA reporting requirements, the Bureau recognizes that many counties may be underserved under the definition being adopted, because it is based on HMDA data, yet additional information (if it were available) could reveal that more than two creditors are significantly active in such counties. The Bureau may examine further whether a refinement to the underserved definition is warranted.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Commentary guidance on “rural” and “underserved” definitions.</em> Comment 35(b)(2)(iv)-1 clarifies that the Bureau will annually update on its Web site a list of counties deemed rural or underserved under the definitions of rural and underserved in § 1026.35(b)(2)(iv). It also clarifies that the definition of rural corresponds to UICs 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12, as determined by the Economic Research Service of the USDA. It further clarifies that the definition of underserved counties is based on HMDA data. Finally, the comment provides that the Bureau also publishes a list of only those counties that are rural but not also underserved, to facilitate compliance with § 1026.35(c).<footnote ref="37">Section 1026.35(c) is being adopted separately by the Bureau jointly with other Federal agencies, to implement the new appraisal requirements in TILA section 129H, in the 2013 Interagency Appraisals Final Rule, as discussed in part III.C, above. That new section provides an exemption for creditors operating in rural, but not underserved, areas. Consequently, the single, combined list of all counties that are either rural or underserved that the Bureau will publish annually for purposes of the exemption from this final rule's escrow requirement is inadequate for the analogous purpose under the new appraisal requirements in § 1026.35(c).</footnote>
            As this final rule takes effect on June 1, 2013, the Bureau expects to publish lists applicable for the current year within approximately four to six weeks after publication of this final rule, but in any event before this final rule takes effect.</analysisParagraph>

            <title>51(a) General Rule</title>
            <analysisSection>
              <title>Overview</title>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is amending 12 CFR 1026.51 and the official interpretations to the regulation in order to address concerns that, in light of the statutory framework established by TILA sections 150 and 127(c)(8), current § 1026.51(a) may be unduly limiting the ability of certain individuals 21 or older, including spouses or partners who do not work outside the home, to obtain credit.</analysisParagraph>
            </analysisSection>
            <analysisSection>
              <title>The Proposal</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Section 1026.51(a) sets forth the general ability-to-pay rule that implements TILA section 150.<footnote ref="21">TILA section 127(c)(8), which sets forth a special rule for consumers who have not attained the age of 21, is implemented in § 1026.51(b) of Regulation Z.</footnote>
          Currently, § 1026.51(a)(1)(i) provides that a card issuer must not open a credit card account for a consumer under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan, or increase any limit applicable to such account, unless the card issuer considers the consumer's independent ability to make the required minimum periodic payments under the terms of the account based on the consumer's income or assets and current obligations. Section 1026.51(a)(1)(ii) further provides that card issuers must establish and maintain reasonable written policies and procedures to consider a consumer's independent income or assets and current obligations, and that such policies and procedures must include consideration of at least one of: the ratio of debt obligations to income; the ratio of debt obligations to assets; or the income the consumer will have after paying debt obligations. Finally, § 1026.51(a)(1)(ii) states that it would be unreasonable for a card issuer not to review any information about a consumer's income or assets and current obligations, or to issue a credit card to a consumer who does not have any independent income or assets. Comments 51(a)(1)(i)-1 through 51(a)(1)(i)-6 set forth additional guidance on compliance with the requirements of § 1026.51(a)(1).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to amend § 1026.51(a) in two related respects. First, the Bureau proposed to remove all references to an “independent” ability to pay from § 1026.51(a)(1) and the associated commentary. Second, the Bureau proposed to permit issuers to consider income or assets to which an applicant or accountholder who is 21 or older—and thus subject to § 1026.51(a) rather than § 1026.51(b)—has a reasonable expectation of access. The Bureau's proposal would have clarified by examples in the commentary those circumstances in which the expectation of access is deemed to be reasonable or unreasonable.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau's November 2012 Proposal noted that the independence requirement was added to § 1026.51(a), and thus made applicable to applicants 21 or older, in the Board's March 2011 Final Rule. In the <em data-original="E-02">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</em> to the March 2011 Final Rule, the Board acknowledged concerns from members of Congress, card issuers, trade associations, and consumers that application of an “independent income” standard might restrict access to credit for consumers who do not work outside the home, including certain married women.<footnote ref="22">76 FR 22948, 22976.</footnote>
          Ultimately, however, the Board concluded that application of this standard would not diminish access to credit for this population of married women and others who do not work outside the home.<footnote ref="23">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>
          In particular, the Board suggested that permitting an issuer to solicit an applicant's “income” and make credit decisions on that basis would protect credit access for these populations.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau noted in the November 2012 Proposal that information made available to it after the March 2011 Final Rule went into effect raised several questions about the Board's assumption in this respect. Specifically, the Bureau has become aware that several issuers have denied card applications from individuals with high credit scores based on the applicant's stated income. Credit bureau data, including data regarding payment history and size of payment obligations, suggested that some of these applicants had demonstrable access to funding sources. Although the Bureau did not have direct evidence of precisely who the unsuccessful applicants are, indirect evidence suggested a meaningful proportion of these denials may have involved applicants who do not work outside the home but who have a spouse or partner who does work outside the home. The Bureau based this conclusion on summary data from a number of issuers on denials of credit card applications from otherwise creditworthy individuals due to the applicants' stated income.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also stated that it does not believe that TILA section 150 requires consideration of the “independent” ability to pay for applicants who are 21 or older. TILA section 150 refers to “the ability of the consumer to make the required payments under the terms of the account” and does not expressly include an independence requirement. In contrast, TILA section 127(c)(8)(B)(ii), which sets forth analogous requirements that apply to consumers who are under 21, expressly requires that the consumer submit financial information, through a written application, that indicates “an independent means of repaying any obligation arising from the proposed extension of credit . . . . ” The Bureau believes that the better reading of TILA section 150, in light of TILA section 127(c)(8), is that it does not impose an independence requirement in the ability-to-pay provision for consumers who are 21 or older.<footnote ref="24">The Bureau noted that TILA section 127(c)(8) itself also sets forth two different ability-to-pay standards, depending on the age of the individual; the Bureau stated that it believes that this further suggests that Congress did not intend to apply an independent ability-to-pay requirement to individuals who are 21 or older. Section 127(c)(8)(B)(i) sets forth the standard that applies to an individual age 21 or older who is serving as a cosigner or otherwise assuming liability on an account being opened by a consumer who is under 21. Section 127(c)(8)(B)(i) states that such over-21 cosigner or similar party must “hav[e] a means to repay debts incurred by the consumer in connection with the account. In contract, as discussed above, section 127(c)(8)(B)(ii) requires the under-21 consumer to submit financial information “indicating an independent means of repaying any obligation arising from the proposed extension of credit in connection with the account.”</footnote>
          
        </analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau noted that the Board came to the contrary conclusion that, because TILA section 150 requires card issuers to consider “the ability of <em data-original="E-03">the consumer</em> to make the required payments” (emphasis added), Congress intended card issuers to consider only the ability to pay of the consumer or consumers who are responsible for making payments on the account.<footnote ref="25">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 76 FR 22975.</footnote>
          The Board further noted that, to the extent that card issuers extend credit based on the income of persons who are not liable on the account, it would be consistent with the purposes of TILA section 150 to restrict this practice.<footnote ref="26">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See id.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>
          
        </analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In issuing its proposal, the Bureau agreed with the Board that the application of an overly broad standard under TILA section 150 could undermine the purposes of the statute by permitting issuers to open accounts for consumers based on income or assets of other individuals in cases where reliance on such income or assets would not reasonably reflect the consumer's ability to use such income or assets to make payments on a credit card debt. Therefore, as discussed below, the Bureau proposed additional guidance to clarify when reliance on a third party's income or assets would be considered unreasonable and, accordingly, could not be used to satisfy § 1026.51(a). However, the Bureau also believed that there are other situations in which card issuers could reasonably rely on the income or assets of a third party in assessing an applicant's ability to pay. The Bureau maintained that nothing in the text of TILA section 150 suggests that it was intended to impose a blanket prohibition on extending credit in the latter circumstances; rather, the plain language of TILA section 150 suggests that it was intended to impose a more flexible standard than the independent ability-to-pay requirement of TILA section 127(c)(8)(B)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, given the likely impact of the Board's March 2011 Final Rule on the access to credit for spouses or partners who do not work outside the home, and based on the Bureau's statutory interpretation of TILA sections 127(c)(8) and 150, the proposed rule would have removed references to an “independent” ability to pay from § 1026.51(a)(1) and the commentary to § 1026.51(a)(1).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Although the Bureau stated that it believes that removing the independent ability-to-pay requirement from § 1026.51(a)(1) would best promote consistency with the statute and would help to mitigate any unintended impacts of the rule on spouses or partners who do not work outside the home, the Bureau also stated that it was important to clarify in more detail the income or assets on which a card issuer may rely in order to comply with § 1026.51(a). Therefore, the Bureau proposed to amend § 1026.51(a)(1)(ii) to clarify that the consideration of a consumer's income or assets may include any income or assets to which the consumer has a reasonable expectation of access. The Bureau believes that the purposes of TILA section 150 would be best effectuated by placing limitations on the income or assets on which an issuer may rely when opening new credit card accounts, or increasing credit limits, for consumers who are 21 or older; accordingly, the proposed rule and proposed commentary would have clarified that there are certain sources of income or assets on which it would be unreasonable for an issuer to rely.<footnote ref="27">The Bureau also proposed several nonsubstantive, technical changes to § 1026.51(a)(1)(ii) for clarity.</footnote>
          
        </analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Current comment 51(a)(1)-4 sets forth guidance regarding the consideration of income and assets under § 1026.51(a). The proposed rule would have replaced current comment 51(a)(1)-4 with new comments 51(a)(1)-4 through -6; current comments 51(a)(1)-5 and -6 would have been renumbered as comments 51(a)(1)-7 and -8. Amended comment 51(a)(1)(i)-4 generally would have incorporated portions of existing comment 51(a)(1)-4.ii, which provides guidance on the income or assets that may be considered for purposes of § 1026.51(a), with reorganization for clarity. In addition, for consistency with proposed § 1026.51(a)(1)(ii), proposed comment 51(a)(1)-4 would have been revised to expressly provide that a card issuer may consider any income and assets to which an applicant, accountholder, cosigner, or guarantor who is or will be liable for debts incurred on the account has a reasonable expectation of access.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 51(a)(1)-5 generally would have incorporated portions of existing comment 51(a)(1)-4.i and -4.iii, which provide guidance on the sources of information about a consumer's income and assets on which a card issuer may rely. Currently, comment 51(a)(1)-4.iii provides that if a card issuer requests on its application forms that applicants provide their income without reference to household income (such as by requesting “income” or “salary”), the card issuer may rely on the information provided by applicants to satisfy the requirements of § 1026.51(a). Proposed comment 51(a)(1)-5.i similarly would have provided that card issuers may rely on information provided by applicants in response to a request for “salary,” “income,” or “assets.” In addition, proposed comment 51(a)(1)-5.i would have clarified that, for purposes of § 1026.51(a), card issuers also may rely on information provided by applicants in response to a request for “available income,” “accessible income,” or other language requesting that the applicant provide information regarding current or reasonably expected income and/or assets or any income and/or assets to which the applicant has a reasonable expectation of access.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau noted that it was retaining in proposed comment 51(a)(1)-5.i existing guidance regarding requests by issuers for “household income.” Proposed comment 51(a)(1)-5.i would have stated that card issuers may not rely solely on information provided in response to a request for “household income”; rather, the card issuer would need to obtain additional information about the applicant's income (such as by contacting the applicant). The Bureau believed that it would be inappropriate to permit an issuer to rely on the income of one or more third parties when opening a credit card account for a consumer merely because the applicant(s) and the other individual(s) share a residence. For example, a household might consist of two roommates who do not have access to one another's income or assets. The Bureau believed that in this case it generally would be inappropriate to permit one roommate to rely on the income or assets of the other; however, given that they share a household, it is possible that one roommate applicant might interpret the request for “household income” to include the other roommate's income.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 51(a)(1)-6 would have provided further clarification regarding when it is permissible to consider a household member's income for purposes of § 1026.51(a).<footnote ref="28">For simplicity and ease of reference, the proposed examples in comment 51(a)(1)-6 would have addressed scenarios involving two individuals who reside in the same household (&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;i.e.,&lt;/em&gt; the applicant and another individual). The examples referred to the second member of the applicant's household as a &amp;#8220;household member.&amp;#8221; However, the Bureau noted that the proposed rule and commentary also would apply to households in which more than two individuals reside.</footnote>
          Proposed comment 51(a)(1)-6 would have set forth four illustrative examples regarding the consideration of a household member's income. Three of the proposed examples would have described circumstances in which the Bureau believes that the applicant has a reasonable expectation of access to a household member's income. Proposed comment 51(a)(1)-6.i would have noted that if a household member's salary is deposited into a joint account shared with the applicant, an issuer is permitted to consider that salary as the applicant's income for purposes of § 1026.51(a). Proposed comment 51(a)(1)-6.ii would have assumed that the household member regularly transfers a portion of his or her salary, which in the first instance is directly deposited into an account to which the applicant does not have access, from that account into a second account to which the applicant does have access. The applicant then uses the account to which he or she has access for the payment of household or other expenses. Proposed comment 51(a)(1)-6.ii would have permitted an issuer to consider the portion of the salary deposited into the account to which the applicant has access as the applicant's income for purposes of § 1026.51(a). The third example in proposed comment 51(a)(1)-6.iii would have assumed that no portion of the household member's salary is deposited into an account to which the applicant has access. However, the household member regularly uses that salary to pay for the applicant's expenses. The proposed example would have clarified that an issuer is permitted to consider the household member's salary as the applicant's income for purposes of § 1026.51(a) because the applicant has a reasonable expectation of access to that salary.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The final example in proposed comment 51(a)(1)-6.iv would have described a situation in which the consumer's expectation of access would not be deemed to be reasonable. The proposed example would have stated that no portion of the household member's salary is deposited into an account to which the applicant has access, the household member does not regularly use that salary to pay for the applicant's expenses, and no Federal or State statute or regulation grants the applicant an ownership interest in that salary. The proposed example would have clarified that an issuer would not be permitted to consider the household member's salary as the applicant's income for purposes of § 1026.51(a).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau solicited comment on whether the examples set forth in proposed comment 51(a)(1)-6 are appropriate, as well as on whether there are additional examples that should be included. Finally, as noted above, the proposal would have renumbered current comment 51(a)(1)-5—which concerns “current obligations”—as comment 51(a)(1)-7 without further change.</analysisParagraph>

            <analysisSection>
              <title>Comments Received</title>
              <analysisParagraph>As noted above, the Bureau received over 300 comments from individual consumers, consumer groups, banks, credit unions, trade groups, card issuers, retailers, and other financial institutions. The majority of industry commenters supported the Bureau's proposal to eliminate the independent ability-to-pay requirement for consumers 21 or older. One industry commenter stated that many of its customers have been frustrated and disappointed by their inability to obtain a credit card because they do not have independent income. Another industry commenter posited that the current standard has reduced access to credit not only for married persons and partners who do not work outside the home, but also for elderly Americans who are increasingly dependent on their adult children for financial assistance. An industry commenter noted the impact of the Bureau's current rules on military spouses, who it maintains are more likely to be under-employed, working part-time, or out of the labor force completely. Most industry commenters, including banks, credit unions, trade groups, card issuers, and retailers, similarly supported language in proposed § 1026.51(a)(1)(ii) to permit card issuers to rely on income or assets to which a consumer has a reasonable expectation of access, but requested certain edits and clarifications, which are discussed in more detail below.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In addition, certain consumer commenters, individually and in connection with advocacy groups representing the interests of women (including mothers who do not work outside the home), strongly supported the Bureau's proposal and urged the Bureau to remove the independent ability-to-pay requirement. These commenters argued that changing the rule is critical to ensuring that stay-at-home spouses and partners are able to build and retain access to credit in the case of abuse, death, or disability of the breadwinner. Some consumer commenters also noted that having a credit card is an essential tool for managing a household and is necessary for making purchases, travel reservations, and bill payments, as well as for qualifying for a business or home loan.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Two consumer group commenters opposed the Bureau's proposal, arguing that the independent ability-to-pay standard could be clarified without removing it altogether. These commenters stated that the Bureau should retain the independent ability-to-pay requirement, but clarify that a person can have income or assets that do not come from that person's individual wages (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> where a non-applicant's income is deposited in a joint account, or another account to which the applicant has access). These commenters argued that an issuer's consideration of a consumer's ability to pay should be based solely on the income or assets controlled by the consumer liable on the account and that it is better for consumers to have a cosigner on the card account than to take on debt based on potentially unreliable income.
        </analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters stated their general opposition to any additional rules that would interfere with a financial institution's ability to make its own underwriting decisions. Other industry commenters expressed concern that card issuers relying on reasonably expected income as an underwriting criterion would have difficulty evaluating whether the applicant truly has the means to repay a debt and, as a result, would inevitably make poor decisions. Several industry commenters urged the Bureau to make it clear that card issuers are not required to consider income to which the consumer has a reasonable expectation of access for applicants 21 or older, but instead may consider, for example, the consumer's independent ability to pay.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Finally, several industry commenters requested that the Bureau clarify in the rule, commentary, or supplementary information that compliance with the ability-to-pay options provided in the proposal does not give rise to discrimination claims based on age, sex, or marital status under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA)<footnote ref="29">15 U.S.C. 1691 &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;et seq.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>
          and Regulation B.<footnote ref="30">12 CFR part 1002.</footnote>
          Specifically, a number of industry commenters requested that the Bureau clarify that application of different ability-to-pay standards to consumers based on age does not violate ECOA or Regulation B because the Credit Card Act, and not the card issuer, requires the different treatment. One industry commenter requested assurances that the continued consideration of the independent ability to pay for consumers 21 or older does not violate Regulation B's prohibition against sex discrimination. Another industry commenter expressed concern that application of the reasonable expectation of access criterion to consumers 21 or older may result in a potential discriminatory practice based on marital status.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>The Final Rule</title>
              <analysisParagraph>The final rule adopts the amendments to § 1026.51(a)(1) substantially as proposed, with several edits and clarifications to address issues raised by commenters. In addition, the final rule adds comment 51(a)(1)-9, which clarifies that issuers may use a single, common application for all consumers, regardless of age.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Ability-to-pay standard.</em> As noted above, § 1026.51(a)(1)(i) currently provides that a card issuer must not open a credit card account for a consumer under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan, or increase any limit applicable to such account, unless the card issuer considers the consumer's independent ability to make the required minimum periodic payments under the terms of the account based on the consumer's income or assets and current obligations. The Bureau acknowledged in the proposal that § 1026.51(a)(1)(i) in its current form may unduly limit the ability of certain individuals age 21 or older to obtain credit. Accordingly, the Bureau proposed to eliminate the independence standard for these consumers and delete all references to the term “independent” from § 1026.51(a)(1) and associated commentary.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Based on comments received as discussed above and its own analysis, the Bureau is adopting its proposal to remove references to the independence standard in § 1026.51(a)(1) and associated commentary. The Bureau believes that the removal of the independence standard from the ability-to-pay requirement will likely result in greater access to credit for stay-at-home spouses and partners and is consistent with the explicit requirements of TILA section 150. As stated above and in the proposal, the Bureau has become aware of several issuers having denied card applications from individuals with high credit scores based on the applicant's stated income. In addition, comments submitted by industry members and consumers corroborate the Bureau's concerns that the current independent ability-to-pay standard has resulted in card issuers denying credit to individuals with high credit scores because they do not have an independent source of income. For example, one industry commenter stated that many of its customers have been frustrated and disappointed by their inability to obtain a credit card because they do not have independent income. One consumer commenter stated that, despite having excellent credit, her application for credit was denied due to lower income resulting from the decision to work only part-time to care for a young child. Another consumer commenter stated that since reentering the workforce after an extended period as a stay-at-home mother, she has twice been denied a credit card because she did not have credit in her own name. A trade group commenter noted the “unfair impact” of the current independent ability-to-pay requirement on military spouses and their families, who it argued rely on the working spouse's income to a greater extent than their civilian counterparts.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As stated above, the Bureau also does not believe that TILA section 150 requires consideration of the “independent” ability to pay for applicants who are 21 or older. TILA section 150 refers to “the ability of the consumer to make the required payments under the terms of the account” and does not expressly include an independence requirement. In contrast, TILA section 127(c)(8)(B)(ii), which sets forth analogous requirements that apply to consumers who are under 21, expressly requires that the consumer demonstrate “an independent means of repaying any obligation arising from the proposed extension of credit . . ..” The Bureau believes that the better reading of TILA section 150, in light of TILA section 127(c)(8), is that it does not impose an independence requirement in the ability-to-pay provision for consumers who are 21 or older.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As also stated above, the Bureau agrees with the Board that the application of an overly broad standard under TILA section 150 could undermine the purposes of the statute by permitting issuers to open accounts for consumers based on income or assets of other individuals in cases where reliance on such income or assets would not reasonably reflect the consumer's ability to use such income or assets to make payments on a credit card debt. Therefore, as discussed below, the Bureau is providing additional guidance to clarify when reliance on a third party's income or assets would be considered unreasonable and, accordingly, could not be used to satisfy § 1026.51(a). However, the Bureau also believes that there are other situations in which card issuers could reasonably rely on the income or assets of a third party in assessing an applicant's ability to pay. Nothing in the text of TILA section 150 suggests that it was intended to impose a blanket prohibition on extending credit in the latter circumstances. Rather, the plain language of TILA section 150 suggests that it was intended to impose a more flexible regulatory standard than the independent ability-to-pay requirement of TILA section 127(c)(8)(B)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, given the likely impact of existing § 1026.51(a) on the access to credit for spouses or partners who do not work outside the home, and based on the Bureau's statutory interpretation of TILA sections 127(c)(8) and 150, the final rule removes all references to an “independent” ability-to-pay standard from § 1026.51(a)(1) and comments 51(a)-1 and -2. However, as discussed below, the final rule states in § 1026.51(a)(1)(ii) that it would be reasonable for a card issuer to consider a consumer's independent income or assets in its consideration of the consumer's ability to pay. This provision is consistent with the approach clarified in the final rule to permit card issuers the flexibility to rely on a consumer's independent income or assets, or as an alternative, income or assets to which a consumer has a reasonable expectation of access. The final rule also makes a non-substantive, technical change in § 1026.51(a)(1)(i) for consistency and clarity.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Reasonable expectation of access.</em> As discussed above, in conjunction with the proposal to amend § 1026.51(a)(1)(i) by removing the term “independent” from the ability-to-pay requirement, the Bureau proposed to amend § 1026.51(a)(1)(ii) to add new language clarifying that the consideration of a consumer's current income or assets may include any income or assets to which the consumer has a reasonable expectation of access. The Bureau also proposed several non-substantive, technical changes to § 1026.51(a)(1)(ii) for clarity.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As noted above, most industry commenters supported the Bureau's proposal in § 1026.51(a)(1)(ii) to permit card issuers to rely on income or assets to which a consumer has a reasonable expectation of access, but suggested certain edits and clarifications as discussed in more detail below. Numerous consumer commenters also supported the Bureau's proposal and posited that changing the ability-to-pay rules is critical to ensuring that non-working spouses and partners have access to credit in the event of abuse, death, or disability of the primary breadwinner.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The consumer group commenters, however, argued that a card issuer should not be permitted to allow a person to take on debt based on income to which the consumer merely has access, which they view as unreliable income. Instead, these commenters argued that the card issuer should require a joint applicant or cosigner on the account if the applicant does not have sufficient current or reasonably expected income or assets to satisfy the independent ability-to-pay requirement. Several industry commenters also expressed concern that issuers relying on a consumer's reasonable expectation of access to income or assets would have difficulty evaluating whether the applicant truly has the means to repay a debt and, as a result, would inevitably make poor decisions. One industry commenter argued that the reasonable expectation of access criterion would present material risks to the underwriting process. Some industry commenters also expressed concern that extending the card issuer's ability to consider reasonably accessible income to that of cosigners and guarantors would add an additional layer of risk to the credit transaction. Several industry commenters urged the Bureau to make clear that card issuers are not required to consider income to which the consumer has a reasonable expectation of access, but instead may consider, for example, the consumer's independent ability to pay.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Based on careful consideration of the comments submitted and its own analysis, the Bureau adopts substantially as proposed amendments to § 1026.51(a)(1)(ii). The final rule retains in § 1026.51(a)(1)(ii) the requirement that card issuers establish and maintain reasonable written policies and procedures to consider the consumer's ability to make the required minimum payments under the terms of the account based on the income or assets and current obligations of card applicants. As amended, this paragraph now provides that such policies and procedures include treating any income and assets to which the consumer has a reasonable expectation of access as the consumer's income or assets, <em data-original="E-03">or</em> limiting consideration of the consumer's income or assets to the consumer's independent income and assets. In other words, a card issuer <em data-original="E-03">may</em> consider income and assets to which an applicant has a reasonable expectation of access, but is not <em data-original="E-03">required</em> to do so. A card issuer has the option of limiting its consideration of an applicant's income and assets to his or her independent income and assets.<footnote ref="31">Several commenters described this option as “continuing” to use the current “independent ability-to-pay standard.” Strictly speaking, however, that regulatory standard no longer exists under the final rule; it has been replaced with the ability-to-pay standard. It is thus more accurate to describe this option as using an independent-income-or-assets underwriting criterion to satisfy the ability-to-pay regulatory standard.</footnote>
          
        </analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also adopts its proposal to conform § 1026.51(a)(1)(ii) to amended § 1026.51(a)(1)(i) by revising it to state that it would be unreasonable for a card issuer not to review any information about a consumer's income or assets and current obligations—rather than the consumer's “independent” income or assets, as stated in the current rule.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Although some commenters expressed concern that the new reasonable expectation of access criterion may result in riskier underwriting and, thus, greater incidence of default, no supporting data was provided and the Bureau is not convinced that would be the case should a card issuer decide to incorporate a consumer's reasonable expectation of access to income as an underwriting criterion. As discussed in greater detail below, the Bureau is providing in the official commentary examples of when it would be reasonable or unreasonable for an issuer to consider the income or assets of a non-applicant to which the applicant claims to have a reasonable expectation of access. In addition, as one commenter noted, the ability-to-pay requirement is not a substitute for other asset-liability management parameters and underwriting criteria used by card issuers in determining whether a consumer is eligible for an extension of credit and may not be evaluated until other underwriting criteria have been analyzed. The Bureau believes that because credit cards are generally unsecured, card issuers will be motivated to carefully review the risk factors available to them regarding a consumer's creditworthiness.<footnote ref="32">Although not addressed in the proposal, consumer group commenters urged the Bureau to ban deferred interest plans on credit card accounts, where such plans promote “no interest” until a certain date, but then retroactively access that interest starting from the purchase date if the consumer does not pay off the entire balance by the specified date. These commenters believed these types of deferred interest plans are unfair and deceptive. Because deferred interest plans are outside the scope of this rulemaking, the comments are not further addressed in this final rule.</footnote>
          
        </analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also proposed changes to the commentary to § 1026.51(a)(1) to reflect the proposed changes to § 1026.51(a)(1). Current comment 51(a)(1)-4 sets forth guidance regarding the consideration of income and assets under § 1026.51(a). The proposed rule would have replaced current comment 51(a)(1)-4 with new comments 51(a)(1)-4 through -6; current comments 51(a)(1)-5 and -6 would have been renumbered as comments 51(a)(1)-7 and -8. The final rule adopts the proposed comments substantially as proposed, with additional clarification and guidance as requested by commenters. The final rule also adopts comment 51(a)(1)-9, which clarifies the requirements for issuers using a single, common application for all consumers, regardless of age.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Amended comment 51(a)(1)-4, as proposed, generally would have incorporated portions of existing comment 51(a)(1)-4.ii, which provides guidance on the income or assets that may be considered for purposes of § 1026.51(a), with reorganization for clarity. In addition, for consistency with proposed § 1026.51(a)(1)(ii), proposed comment 51(a)(1)-4 would have been revised to expressly provide that a card issuer may consider any income or assets to which an applicant, accountholder, cosigner, or guarantor who is or will be liable for debts incurred on the account has a reasonable expectation of access. In response to the Bureau's proposal, one industry commenter requested that the Bureau clarify in the commentary that income or assets available to a consumer under state community property laws should be eligible for consideration as income or assets to which a consumer has a reasonable expectation of access. The Bureau received no other specific comments on this aspect of the proposal.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The final rule revises proposed comment 51(a)(1)-4 in a number of ways in response to comments received and to make further clarifications. To begin with, the final rule clarifies in comment 51(a)(1)-4.i that, for purposes of § 1026.51(a), a card issuer may treat any income and assets to which an applicant has a reasonable expectation of access as the consumer's current or reasonably expected income or assets, but is not required to do so. The final rule further clarifies that a card issuer may instead limit its consideration of the consumer's current or reasonably expected income or assets to his or her independent income and assets, and notes that such an issuer may look to the guidance provided in comments 51(b)(1)(i)-1 and 51(b)(2)-2 for the purpose of using independent income and assets as an underwriting criterion. Finally, the final rule corrects an inadvertent omission in the proposal by adding the term “joint applicant” to comment 51(a)(1)-4.i.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In comment 51(a)(1)-4.ii, the final rule clarifies that current or reasonably expected income and assets includes income that is being deposited regularly into an account on which the consumer is an accountholder (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> an individual deposit account or joint account). For the reasons discussed below, comment 51(a)(1)-4.ii also clarifies that proceeds from student loans may be treated as current or reasonably expected income, provided that the card issuer only considers the loan proceeds remaining after tuition and other expenses have been disbursed to the applicant's educational institution.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Finally, the final rule revises comment 51(a)(1)-4.iii. in several ways. In response to a request for clarification, the final rule includes State community property laws as an example of a Federal or State statute or regulation that grants a consumer an ownership interest in the income and assets of another person. The final rule also clarifies that a card issuer may consider the consumer's current or reasonably expected income to include the income of authorized users, household members, or other persons who are not liable for debts incurred on the account if that income is regularly deposited into an account on which the consumer is an accountholder (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> an individual deposit account or joint account). The Bureau believes that such income may be considered the consumer's current or reasonably expected income, even though it is not the consumer's individual wages, because the consumer has access to the non-applicant's income that is being deposited regularly into an account on which the consumer is an accountholder. As discussed below, the final rule revises the examples in comment 51(a)(1)-6 to be consistent with the revisions to comment 51(a)(1)-4.iii.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 51(a)(1)-5 generally would have incorporated portions of existing comment 51(a)(1)-4.i and -4.iii, which provide guidance on the sources of information about a consumer's income and assets on which a card issuer may rely. Currently, comment 51(a)(1)-4.iii provides that, if a card issuer requests on its application forms that applicants provide their income without reference to household income (such as by requesting “income” or “salary”), the card issuer may rely on the information provided by applicants in response to such prompts to satisfy the requirements of § 1026.51(a). Proposed comment 51(a)(1)-5.i similarly would have provided that card issuers may rely on information provided by applicants in response to a request for “salary,” “income,” or “assets.” In addition, proposed comment 51(a)(1)-5.i would have clarified that, for purposes of § 1026.51(a), card issuers also may rely on information provided by applicants in response to a request for “available income,” “accessible income,” or other language requesting that the applicant provide information regarding current or reasonably expected income or assets or any income or assets to which the applicant has a reasonable expectation of access.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 51(a)(1)-5.i also retained existing guidance regarding requests by issuers for “household income.” Specifically, proposed comment 51(a)(1)-5.i would have stated that card issuers may not rely solely on information provided in response to a request for “household income”; rather, the card issuer would need to obtain additional information about the applicant's income (such as by contacting the applicant). The Bureau stated in the proposal that it believes that it would be inappropriate to permit an issuer to rely on the income of one or more third parties when opening a credit card account for a consumer merely because the applicant(s) and the other individual(s) share a residence. For example, a household might consist of two roommates who do not have access to one another's income or assets. The Bureau also stated that it believes that in this case it generally would be inappropriate to permit one roommate to rely on the income or assets of the other; however, given that they share a household, it is possible that one roommate applicant might interpret the request for “household income” to include the other roommate's income.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters stated that it was unclear whether card issuers would be required to take additional steps to confirm information provided as part of an application, and urged the Bureau to clarify what, if any, verification of applicant information is required. One industry commenter suggested that the Bureau add the term “solely” or “without further inquiry” to comment 51(a)(1)-5 to better illustrate that card issuers are not required to verify financial information received in response to prompts for “salary,” “income,” “assets,” “available income,” “accessible income,” or other language requesting that the applicant provide information regarding current or reasonably expected income or assets or any income or assets to which the applicant has a reasonable expectation of access. The consumer group commenters, however, indicated that card issuers should be required to obtain some verification of whatever income source is relied upon.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters also suggested that the card issuer be permitted to rely on income information provided by the consumer on an application in response to prompts for “household income” without additional information. These commenters argued that consumers are more familiar with the term “household income” than the allowable terms suggested in the proposal, such as “accessible income” and “available income,” and that the term elicits the type of income the Bureau's proposal is designed to permit issuers to use in ability-to-pay considerations. One commenter commissioned its own study, which it states indicated that “household income” is a meaningful term for consumers, and that a request for “household income” elicited the appropriate type of income for an ability-to-pay determination. The commenter also stated that few of the respondents in its study provided the income of a roommate or similar household member when asked for “household income.” The commenter suggested that the Bureau allow card issuers to rely on information received from consumers in response to a prompt for income using the term “household income,” provided that the request is qualified with a phrase such as “that the applicant can access.” Another industry commenter questioned whether the term “accessible household income” would be more likely than “available income” or “accessible income” to elicit a response inclusive of a spouse's or partner's income.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The final rule adopts comment 51(a)(1)-5 substantially as proposed with additional clarification. First, in response to inquiries regarding card issuers' obligations to verify information included in applications received from consumers, the Bureau clarifies in comment 51(a)(1)-5.i that card issuers are not required to verify financial information received in response to prompts for “salary,” “income,” “assets,” “available income,” “accessible income,” or other language requesting that the applicant provide information regarding current or reasonably expected income or assets and any income or assets to which the applicant has a reasonable expectation of access. Specifically, the final rule revises comment 51(a)(1)-5 to state that card issuers may rely without further inquiry on information provided by applicants in response to prompts for financial information that are consistent with the guidance in comment 51(a)(1)-5.i. The Bureau notes that this clarification does not alter the current rule, which does not require verification of income information provided in response to prompts such as “salary” or “income.”</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The final rule also clarifies in comment 51(a)(1)-5.i the circumstances under which a card issuer may not rely solely on information provided in a credit card application. Specifically, comment 51(a)(1)-5.i, as adopted, states that card issuers may not rely on information provided in response to a request for “household income”; rather, the card issuer must obtain additional information about the applicant's income, including income to which the applicant has a reasonable expectation of access (such as by contacting the applicant). The Bureau does not believe it is appropriate to allow card issuers to rely on information provided in response to “household income” to determine the consumer's current or reasonably expected income for purposes of the ability-to-pay standard in § 1026.51(a). The Bureau remains concerned that the term “household income” may generate financial data for income to which the applicant has no expectation of access. As stated in the proposal, the Bureau believes that it would be inappropriate to permit a card issuer to rely on the income of one or more third parties when opening a credit card account for a consumer merely because the applicant(s) and the other individuals share a residence. For example, a household might consist of two roommates who do not have access to one another's income or assets. The Bureau believes that in this case it generally would be inappropriate to permit one roommate to rely on the income or assets of the other; however, given that they share a household, it is possible that one roommate applicant might interpret the request for “household income” to include the other roommate's income. As noted above, one industry commenter relied on a study of prospective and current cardholders in urging the Bureau to permit card issuers to rely on information provided in response to a request for “household income.” However, it is not clear whether prompting respondents for “income” or another allowable term would have produced different information than was received in response to a request for “household income.” Further, it appears that some respondents indicated that they might include a roommate's income in response to a request for “household income.” Thus, the Bureau does not believe that the study warrants revising the treatment of household income. Accordingly, the final rule retains in comment 51(a)(1)-5.i the requirement that card issuers obtain additional information about an applicant's income (such as by contacting the applicant) in response to a request for “household income.” Comment 51(a)(1)-5.i as adopted also clarifies that if a card issuer chooses to prompt consumers for financial information using the term “household income” on credit card applications, a card issuer may use the guidance in comments 51(a)(1)-4, -5 and -6 when collecting additional information to determine the consumer's current or reasonably expected income under § 1026.51(a).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, several consumer groups indicated that card issuers should be required to obtain some verification of whatever income source is stated on the application. As also discussed above, the final rule generally does not require that card issuers verify the income information that an applicant indicates on an application (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> except in the circumstances discussed in comment 51(a)(1)-5). The Bureau notes that TILA section 150 does not require verification of a consumer's ability to make required payments. Moreover, credit card applications are usually solicited and received en masse and, as one industry commenter noted, are usually subject to a heavily automated process. To require verification of information from masses of applications received at once would likely increase approval times, resulting in greater consumer inconvenience and costs to card issuers. As a result, the Bureau believes that card issuers should be afforded the flexibility to determine instances when they need to verify information. Furthermore, because these accounts are generally unsecured, the Bureau believes that card issuers have business reasons to seek supplemental information or clarification when either the information supplied by the applicant is inconsistent with the data the card issuers already have or are able to gather on the consumer or when the risk in the amount of the credit line warrants such follow-up. Nonetheless, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to require card issuers to collect additional information regarding the applicant's current or reasonably expected income (such as by contacting the applicant) when the application uses the term “household income.” As discussed above, the Bureau believes that this term could lead an applicant to overstate the applicant's current or reasonably expected income that may be considered for purposes of § 1026.51(a)(1).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 51(a)(1)-6 provided further guidance on when it is permissible to consider a household member's income for purposes of § 1026.51(a).<footnote ref="33">For simplicity and ease of reference, the proposed examples in comment 51(a)(1)-6 addressed scenarios involving two individuals who reside in the same household (&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;i.e.,&lt;/em&gt; the applicant and another individual). The examples referred to the second member of the applicant's household as a &amp;#8220;household member.&amp;#8221; However, the Bureau noted that the proposed rule and commentary also would apply to households in which more than two individuals reside.</footnote>

          Proposed comment 51(a)(1)-6 set forth four illustrative examples regarding the consideration of a household member's income and explained how income and assets would be treated in those scenarios pursuant to the ability-to-pay standard in § 1026.51(a). Proposed comment 51(a)(1)-6.i noted that if a household member's salary is deposited into a joint account shared with the applicant, an issuer is permitted to consider that salary as the applicant's income for purposes of § 1026.51(a). Proposed comment 51(a)(1)-6.ii assumed that the household member regularly transfers a portion of his or her salary, which in the first instance is directly deposited into an account to which the applicant does not have access, from that account into a second account to which the applicant does have access. The applicant then uses the account to which he or she has access for the payment of household or other expenses. An issuer is permitted to consider the portion of the salary deposited into the account to which the applicant has access as the applicant's income for purposes of § 1026.51(a). The third example in proposed comment 51(a)(1)-6.iii assumed that no portion of the household member's salary is deposited into an account to which the applicant has access. However, the household member regularly uses that salary to pay for the applicant's expenses. The example clarified that an issuer is permitted to consider the household member's salary as the applicant's income for purposes of § 1026.51(a) because the applicant has a reasonable expectation of access to that salary.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The final example in proposed comment 51(a)(1)-6.iv described a situation in which the consumer's expectation of access would not be deemed to be reasonable. The example stated that no portion of the household member's salary is deposited into an account to which the applicant has access, the household member does not regularly use that salary to pay for the applicant's expenses, and no Federal or State statute or regulation grants the applicant an ownership interest in that salary. The proposed comment clarified that an issuer would not be permitted to consider the household member's salary as the applicant's income for purposes of § 1026.51(a).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters indicated concern that comment 51(a)(1)-6 only addresses situations involving the salary of a household member. These commenters also raised concerns about whether card issuers could rely on these examples in situations where spouses or partners do not reside in the same physical location (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> military spouses, graduate students, elderly parents). Several industry commenters suggested that the comment be revised to indicate that residence in the same physical location or dwelling is not a prerequisite to be considered members of the same household. Another industry commenter suggested that the Bureau replace the term “household member” with “non-applicant” or, in the alternative, add examples to the commentary that would apply to applicants and non-applicants that do not reside in the same household. This commenter also suggested defining “household” in the commentary as “a social unit that shares resources regardless of whether the unit shares one residence.”</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters also suggested that the examples in proposed comment 51(a)(1)-6 should be revised to refer to “salary or other income” so that it is clear that the examples also address income that may come from a variety of sources such as Social Security benefits, veteran's benefits, retirement income, and investment income. One industry commenter also suggested that the examples in proposed comment 51(a)(1)-6.ii should be revised to delete the reference to “payment of household or other expenses” as unnecessary. One industry commenter was concerned that the language in the prelude to the examples in which the applicant is described as unemployed may lead some to believe that unemployment is a prerequisite to application of the reasonable expectation of access criterion and, thus, should be deleted.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The final rule adopts comment 51(a)(1)-6 as proposed in substance, but makes several amendments in response to commenters' concerns and requests for clarification. First, comment 51(a)(1)-6, as adopted, clarifies that the card issuer may consider a consumer's reasonable expectation of access to the salary or other income of any non-applicant, including, but not limited to, a household member. Accordingly, the final rule removes all references to “household members” in the examples and replaces them with the term “non-applicant.” In addition, the examples in comment 51(a)(1)-6 also refer to the non-applicant's “salary or other income” to make clear that the examples also address income that may come from a variety of sources such as Social Security benefits, veteran's benefits, retirement income, and investment income. Also, as discussed above, the final rule revises comment 51(a)(1)-6 to make the examples more consistent with the interpretations set forth in comment 51(a)(1)-4.iii, as adopted in the final rule.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Specifically, as revised in the final rule, the example in comment 51(a)(1)-6.i assumes that a non-applicant's salary or other income is deposited regularly into a joint account shared with the applicant. This example clarifies that a card issuer is permitted to consider the amount of the non-applicant's income that is being deposited regularly into the account to be the applicant's current or reasonably expected income for purposes of § 1026.51(a). In this case, the applicant would have a current or expected ownership interest in the non-applicant's income that is being deposited regularly into the joint account.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The example in comment 51(a)(1)-6.ii assumes that the non-applicant's salary or other income is deposited into an account to which the applicant does not have access. However, the non-applicant regularly transfers a portion of that income into the applicant's individual deposit account. The example in comment 51(a)(1)-6.ii provides that a card issuer is permitted to consider the amount of the non-applicant's income that is being transferred regularly into the applicant's account to be the applicant's current or reasonably expected income for purposes of § 1026.51(a).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The example in comment 51(a)(1)-6.iii assumes that the non-applicant's salary or other income is deposited into an account to which the applicant does not have access. However, the non-applicant regularly uses a portion of that income to pay for the applicant's expenses. This example clarifies that a card issuer is permitted to consider the amount of the non-applicant's income that is used regularly to pay for the applicant's expenses to be the applicant's current or reasonably expected income for purposes of § 1026.51(a). The Bureau agrees with certain commenters that this example is important because it makes clear that income in which a consumer has a reasonable expectation of access includes situations where the non-applicant's income is not deposited into a shared account to which the applicant has access. It is possible that a non-working spouse or partner does not have a shared account with the non-applicant but regularly receives income from that person.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Finally, the example in comment 51(a)(1)-6.iv assumes that the non-applicant's salary or other income is deposited into an account to which the applicant does not have access, the non-applicant does not regularly use that income to pay for the applicant's expenses, and no Federal or State statute or regulation grants the applicant an ownership interest in that income. This example clarifies that a card issuer is not permitted to consider the non-applicant's income as the applicant's current or expected income for purposes of § 1026.51(a).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, one industry commenter was concerned that the language in the prelude to the examples in which the applicant is described as unemployed may lead some to believe that unemployment is a prerequisite to application of the reasonable access criterion and, thus, should be deleted. The final rule retains in comment 51(a)(1)-6 the language in the prelude to the examples in which the applicant is described as unemployed. The Bureau believes that this language is useful for the examples to clarify that the applicant does not have income earned from his or her own wages. Nonetheless, the Bureau notes that a card issuer may still rely on the examples in comment 51(a)(1)-6, even if the applicant is employed.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Single application.</em> The Bureau recognized in the proposal that, as a practical matter, a card issuer is likely to use a single application form for all consumers, regardless of age, and solicited comment on how, as a practical matter, card issuers are likely to prompt consumers for income and assets in light of the two different income criteria that may be used to satisfy the ability-to-pay income requirements, which would be applied to consumers based on age. One commenter noted that it has not yet determined how it will modify its application, but urged the Bureau to retain flexibility in the rule so that card issuers may rely on income and assets information provided in the application process. Several commenters similarly urged the Bureau to provide card issuers with the flexibility to develop the application and approaches to be used to interact with consumers under the revised standard. Some commenters urged the Bureau to state in the final rule that issuers are permitted to use a single application form for all consumers, regardless of age. Other commenters requested clarification on whether issuers would be required or permitted to include the commentary examples on the credit card application. Another commenter stated that issuers need the flexibility to develop approaches suitable to the context of the application, whether it is direct mail, point of sale, on-line, or mobile.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with commenters that additional clarification regarding the type, format, and content of credit card applications would be helpful. Accordingly, the final rule adopts comment 51(a)(1)-9, which clarifies that card issuers may use a single, common application form or process for all consumers, regardless of age. Comment 51(a)(1)-9 also clarifies that a card issuer may prompt applicants, regardless of age, using only the term “income” and satisfy the ability-to-pay requirements of both § 1026.51(a) and (b). In such cases, additional verification of information provided in the application would not be required. In situations where a card issuer chooses not to prompt only for “income” on a common application, comment 51(a)(1)-9 provides guidance on combinations of terms that may be used to elicit the type of income information required under both ability-to-pay standards. Specifically, comment 51(a)(1)-9 provides as an example a scenario where the application form includes two line items, one prompting applicants for “personal income,” and another prompting applicants for “available income.” The Bureau believes that this combination of terms would not require additional information because the term “personal income” would appropriately prompt applicants under 21 for individual income as required by § 1026.51(b), while the term “available income” would prompt an applicant for financial information that may be considered under § 1026.51(a). Consistent with comment 51(a)(1)-5.i, comment 51(a)(1)-9 as adopted in the final rule clarifies that combined prompts containing terms identified in comments 51(a)(1)-5.i and 51(b)(1)(i)-2.i, when used in a manner consistent with the commentary, do not require additional information beyond what is provided by the consumer on the application.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Current obligations.</em> As discussed above, the proposal would have revised § 1026.51(a)(1)(ii) to provide that card issuers must establish and maintain reasonable written policies and procedures to consider a consumer's income or assets and a consumer's current obligations, which may include any income and assets to which the consumer has a reasonable expectation of access. Reasonable policies and procedures to consider a consumer's ability to make the required payments include the consideration of at least one of the following: The ratio of debt obligations to income; the ratio of debt obligations to assets; or the income the consumer will have after paying debt obligations. The proposal stated that it would be unreasonable for a card issuer not to review any information about a consumer's income or assets or current obligations, or to issue a credit card to a consumer who does not have any income or assets. As noted above, the Bureau also renumbered current comment 51(a)(1)-5—which concerns “current obligations”—as comment 51(a)(1)-7 and solicited comment on whether additional guidance on this subject is appropriate or necessary in light of the proposed changes to § 1026.51(a) and the official interpretation to that subsection.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Several consumer groups indicated that if the Bureau is going to permit the payment of expenses by a household member to be considered as “income” for an applicant, then it should also establish a parallel requirement that issuers consider those <em data-original="E-03">expenses</em> when determining an applicant's ability to pay. In other words, if payment of household expenses by another constitutes income, then those household expenses should be included in the analysis required by § 1026.51(a)(1)(ii). These commenters indicated that otherwise, an individual with high expenses, who receives help with those expenses from another person, would be deemed inaccurately to have sufficient income to pay the credit card debt. These commenters also indicated that § 1026.51(a)(1)(ii) also only appears to require consideration of credit obligations, without explicit consideration of other non-debt expenses, such as food and utilities, and urged the Bureau to revise § 1026.51(a)(1)(ii) to provide explicitly that issuers must consider household expenses in the overall analysis of an applicant's ability to pay. These commenters suggested that a simple method of approximating household expenses for an applicant would be to use the Internal Revenue Service's Collection Financial Standards. Another commenter argued that the reasonable expectation of access standard would make it difficult to assess an applicant's creditworthiness because only the applicant's personal debt is required.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Based on careful review of the comments, the Bureau declines to add additional requirements for considering debt obligations. The Bureau believes that the current commentary provides card issuers the flexibility to obtain information regarding debt obligations directly from the consumer or in a consumer report and does not prohibit a card issuer from considering household expenses in evaluating a consumer's current obligations. The Bureau also believes it would be unduly burdensome to require card issuers to consider the debt obligations of a non-applicant because such information may generally not be available to the consumer at the time of applying for credit and to require such information may needlessly result in the denial of credit to otherwise creditworthy individuals or discourage consumers from applying at all. Accordingly, the final rule adopts comment 51(a)(1)-7 as proposed.

            <title>51(b) Rules Affecting Young Consumers</title>
            <analysisSection>
              <title>The Proposal</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Section 1026.51(b) implements TILA section 127(c)(8) and sets forth special ability-to-pay rules for consumers who are under the age of 21. Section 1026.51(b)(1) currently provides that a card issuer may not open a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan for a consumer less than 21 years old unless the consumer has submitted a written application and the card issuer has either: (i) Financial information indicating the consumer has an independent ability to make the required minimum periodic payments on the proposed extension of credit in connection with the account, consistent with § 1026.51(a); or (ii) a signed agreement of a cosigner, guarantor, or joint applicant, who is at least 21 years old, to be either secondarily liable for any debt on the account incurred before the consumer has attained the age of 21 or jointly liable with the consumer for any debt on the account, and financial information indicating that such cosigner, guarantor, or joint applicant has the independent ability to make the required minimum periodic payments on such debts, consistent with § 1026.51(a).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed several amendments to § 1026.51(b) for conformity with the proposed amendments to § 1026.51(a) discussed above. First, § 1026.51(b)(1)(i) currently provides that a card issuer may open a credit card account for a consumer under the age of 21 if the card issuer has “[f]inancial information indicating the consumer has an independent ability to make the required minimum periodic payments on the proposed extension of credit in connection with the account, <em data-original="E-03">consistent with paragraph (a) of this section.”</em> (Emphasis added.) As discussed above, the proposal would have removed the independence standard from the general ability-to-pay standard in § 1026.51(a), but proposed § 1026.51(b) would have continued to require that consumers under the age of 21 without a cosigner or similar party who is 21 years or older have an independent ability to pay, consistent with TILA section 127(c)(8). Accordingly, the Bureau proposed to delete the phrase “consistent with paragraph (a) of this section” from § 1026.51(b)(1)(i), to reflect the difference in ability-to-pay standards for consumers who are 21 or older and consumers who are under the age of 21. Similarly, the Bureau proposed to delete from § 1026.51(b)(1)(ii)(B) a reference to the independent ability to pay of a cosigner, guarantor, or joint applicant who is 21 or older, consistent with proposed § 1026.51(a), which would have required that consumers who are 21 or older only have the ability to pay, rather than the independent ability to pay.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also proposed several new comments that would have explained specifically how the independent ability-to-pay standard under § 1026.51(b)(1)(i) differs from the more general ability-to-pay standard in proposed § 1026.51(a). Proposed comment 51(b)(1)(i)-1 generally would have addressed sources of income and assets that an issuer may consider and would have made clear that under the independent ability-to-pay standard in § 1026.51(b)(1)(i) a card issuer may not consider income and assets to which the applicant has only a reasonable expectation of access as is permitted under the general ability-to-pay standard in proposed § 1026.51(a). For example, proposed comment 51(b)(1)(i)-1.i would have noted that, because § 1026.51(b)(1)(i) requires that the consumer who has not attained the age of 21 have an independent ability to make the required minimum periodic payments, the card issuer may only consider the current or reasonably expected income and assets of an applicant or accountholder who is less than 21 years old under § 1026.51(b)(1)(i). In addition, proposed comment 51(b)(1)(i)-1.i would have noted that the card issuer may not consider income or assets to which an applicant, accountholder, cosigner, or guarantor, in each case who is under the age of 21 and is or will be liable for debts incurred on the account, has only a reasonable expectation of access under § 1026.51(b)(1)(i).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 51(b)(1)(i)-2 generally would have provided interpretations on the sources of information on which a card issuer may rely for purposes of determining the consumer's current or reasonably expected income and assets under § 1026.51(b)(1)(i). For example, proposed comment 51(b)(1)(i)-2.i would have stated that card issuers may rely on information provided by applicants in response to a request for “salary,” “income,” “assets,” or other language requesting that the applicant provide information regarding current or reasonably expected income and/or assets. The proposed comment also would have provided, however, that card issuers may not rely solely on information provided in response to a request for “available income,” “accessible income,” or “household income.” Instead, the card issuer would have needed to obtain additional information about an applicant's income (such as by contacting the applicant). In addition, proposed comment 51(b)(1)(i)-3 would have set forth four factual scenarios and would have explained how income would be treated in those scenarios pursuant to the independent ability-to-pay standard in § 1026.51(b)(1)(i).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau proposed to amend existing comment 51(b)(1)-2 and to redesignate it as comment 51(b)(1)(ii)-1. Existing comment 51(b)(1)-2 states that information regarding income and assets that satisfies the requirements of § 1026.51(a) satisfies the requirements of § 1026.51(b)(1). In the supplementary information to the proposal, the Bureau noted that, as proposed, income and assets that satisfy the requirements of § 1026.51(a) might no longer satisfy the requirements under § 1026.51(b) for an applicant who is under the age of 21; however, income and assets that satisfy the requirements of § 1026.51(a) would satisfy the ability-to-pay requirements of § 1026.51(b)(1)(ii)(B) (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> those that apply to a cosigner, guarantor, or joint applicant who is 21 or older). Proposed comment 51(b)(1)(ii)-1 accordingly would have stated that information regarding income and assets that satisfies the requirements of § 1026.51(a) also satisfies the requirements of § 1026.51(b)(1)(ii)(B).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In the supplementary information to the proposal, the Bureau noted that one consequence of the proposed rule would be that a spouse or partner who is 21 or older and does not work outside the home could rely on income to which that consumer has a reasonable expectation of access. In many cases, spouses or partners who are 21 or older who do not work outside the home could, accordingly, rely on the income of a working spouse or partner and could open a new credit card account without needing a cosigner, guarantor, or joint applicant. However, the proposed rule would not have permitted an applicant who is under the age of 21 to rely on income or assets that are merely accessible. In the supplementary information to the proposal, the Bureau explained that it expects that in some cases, depending on the specific circumstances, non-working spouses or partners under the age of 21 may need to apply jointly with their income-earning spouse or partner or to offer that spouse or partner as a guarantor on the account. The Bureau believes that this outcome is consistent with the independent ability-to-pay standard that TILA section 127(c)(8) applies to applicants who have not attained the age of 21. At the same time, the Bureau understood that the proposed rule may result in it being more difficult for spouses or partners under 21 who do not work outside the home to obtain credit, as compared to spouses or partners who are 21 or older who do not work outside the home.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In the supplementary information to the proposal, the Bureau noted that a prohibition on discrimination based on marital status is a long-standing and fundamental tenet of fair lending law and, given that TILA section 127(c)(8) imposes a more stringent independent ability-to-pay standard on applicants who are under the age of 21 than on those who are 21 or older, the Bureau stated its belief that it would be inappropriate to apply the “reasonable expectation of access” income criterion to all applicants who are under 21. However, the Bureau also solicited comment on whether additional guidance was needed to clarify application of the rule to applicants under the age of 21, particularly spouses or partners who do not work outside the home. If such clarification was warranted, the Bureau solicited comment on how such guidance could be provided in a manner consistent with TILA section 127(c)(8), ECOA, and Regulation B.<footnote ref="34">15 U.S.C. 1691 &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;et seq.;&lt;/em&gt; 12 CFR part 1002.</footnote>

              <title>Comments Received</title>
              <analysisParagraph>In response to the proposal, several industry commenters urged the Bureau to revise existing § 1026.51(b)(1) to remove the independent ability-to-pay standard for consumers under 21 years of age, and instead apply the general ability-to-pay standard as proposed in § 1026.51(a) to all consumers. One industry commenter also stated that the decision to extend credit should be based on a card issuer's risk management standards and that the rule should not set forth an independent ability-to-pay standard for consumers under the age of 21. This commenter stated that many consumers under the age of 21 are married with families, jobs, and obligations that necessitate the availability of open-end credit. This commenter urged the Bureau to provide some flexibility for card issuers to apply the criterion for applicants that are 21 or older to applicants under the age of 21 who have a reasonable expectation of access to a household member's income. Another industry commenter urged the Bureau to permit card issuers to consider the use of all household income in the application process, and apply rules consistently across all ages, which the commenter stated would produce a more efficient and fair process that is easily understood and executed. This commenter also stated that such a rule would avoid the negative impact to those applicants under the age of 21 who have a partner or spouse by allowing them to report all household income. Another industry commenter requested that the Bureau amend § 1026.51(b)(1) to permit a card issuer to consider the shared income of a consumer who is younger than 21 and is legally married to a consumer 21 years or older.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In addition, several industry commenters and consumer groups requested that the Bureau consider several clarifying revisions to proposed commentary that would have interpreted § 1026.51(b)(1). Also, several industry commenters urged the Bureau to state specifically that compliance with this final rule does not result in a violation of the Regulation B prohibition against age-based discrimination. These suggestions by commenters are discussed in more detail below.</analysisParagraph>
            </analysisSection>
            <analysisSection>
              <title>The Final Rule</title>
              <analysisParagraph>The final rule adopts § 1026.51(b)(1)(i) as proposed. As adopted, § 1026.51(b)(1)(i) continues to require that consumers under the age of 21 without a cosigner or similar party who is 21 years or older have an independent ability to pay, consistent with TILA section 127(c)(8).<footnote ref="35">One industry commenter a requested that the Bureau specifically exempt secured credit cards from the independent ability-to-pay standard set forth in § 1026.51(b)(1)(i). The final rule does not exempt secured credit card accounts from the requirements of § 1026.51(b)(1)(i). The Bureau believes that adopting such an exemption is outside the scope of the changes considered as part of this rulemaking.</footnote>

          As adopted, comment 51(b)(1)(i)-1.i notes that, because § 1026.51(b)(1)(i) requires that the consumer who has not attained the age of 21 have an independent ability to make the required minimum periodic payments, the card issuer may only consider the current or reasonably expected income or assets of an applicant who is less than 21 years old under § 1026.51(b)(1)(i). Comment 51(b)(1)(i)-1.i also notes that under § 1026.51(b)(1)(i), a consumer's current or reasonably expected income may not include income to which the consumer only has a reasonable expectation of access. Comment 51(b)(1)(i)-1.ii clarifies the sources of income that may be considered as current or reasonably expected income and that current or reasonably expected income includes income regularly deposited into an account on which the consumer is an accountholder. Under comment 51(b)(1)(i)-1.iii, an applicant's current or reasonably expected income includes not only current or reasonably expected income earned by the applicant, but also income earned by a non-applicant where Federal or State statute or regulation grants the applicant an ownership interest in such income and assets (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> joint ownership granted under State community property laws), or where the non-applicant's income is being deposited regularly into an account on which the applicant is an accountholder (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> an individual deposit account or joint account). However, comment 51(b)(1)(i)-1.i notes that the card issuer may not consider under § 1026.51(b)(1)(i) income or assets to which an applicant, joint applicant, cosigner, or guarantor, in each case who is under the age of 21 and is or will be liable for debts incurred on the account, has only a reasonable expectation of access without a current or expected ownership interest as discussed above.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The final rule also adopts § 1026.51(b)(1)(ii)(B) as proposed, which provides that where there is a cosigner, guarantor, or joint applicant who is 21 or older, such consumers who are 21 or older need only to have an ability to pay, consistent with § 1026.51(a) as adopted in the final rule, rather than an independent ability to pay under § 1026.51(b). In addition, as discussed in more detail below, the final rule revises § 1026.51(b)(2) to provide that, for credit card accounts that were opened by consumers under the age of 21 without a cosigner or similar party who is 21 years or older, no increase in the credit limit may be made on such account before the consumer attains the age of 21 unless, at the time of the contemplated increase, the consumer has an independent ability to make the required minimum periodic payments on the increased limit, consistent with § 1026.51(b)(1)(i), or a cosigner, guarantor or joint applicant who is at least 21 years old agrees in writing to assume liability for any debt incurred on the account, consistent with § 1026.51(b)(1)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the Bureau recognizes that one consequence of the final rule is that a spouse or partner age 21 or older who does not work outside the home could rely on income to which that consumer has a reasonable expectation of access. In many cases, spouses or partners who are 21 or older and do not work outside the home could, accordingly, rely on the income of a working spouse or partner and could open a new credit card account without needing a cosigner, guarantor, or joint applicant. However, the final rule does not permit an applicant who is under 21 to rely on income or assets that are merely accessible. Instead, the final rule implements the independent ability-to-pay standard that TILA section 127(c)(8) applies to applicants who have not attained the age of 21. Thus, in some cases, depending on the specific circumstances, non-working spouses or partners under 21 may need to apply jointly with their income-earning spouse or partner or to offer that spouse or partner as a guarantor on the account. The Bureau believes this is the outcome compelled by the Credit Card Act.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail below, the Bureau notes, however, that the final rule in comments 51(b)(1)(i)-1.iii and -3 provides that a card issuer is permitted to consider a non-applicant's income (or portion of that income) to be the applicant's current or reasonably expected income where a Federal or State statute or regulation either grants the applicant an ownership interest in such income (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> joint ownership granted under State community property laws) or such income is being deposited regularly into an account on which the applicant is an accountholder <em data-original="E-03">(e.g.,</em> an individual deposit account or joint account). These interpretations make clear that card issuers may rely on such income of non-working spouses or partners under the age of 21 to open a new credit card account.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, one industry commenter requested that the Bureau amend § 1026.51(b)(1) to permit a card issuer to consider the shared income of a consumer under 21 who is legally married to a consumer 21 years or older, in obtaining credit. The Bureau does not believe it is appropriate to revise § 1026.51(b)(1) to permit certain married consumers under the age of 21 to rely on income or assets that are merely accessible, while requiring all consumers under the age of 21 who are not married to meet an independent ability-to-pay requirement. As discussed above, the Bureau believes that a prohibition on discrimination based on marital status is a long-standing and fundamental tenet of fair lending law. And while TILA section 127(c)(8) imposes a more stringent independent ability-to-pay standard on applicants who are under 21 than on those who are 21 or older, it does not make the same distinction based on marital status. For that reason, the Bureau believes that it would be inappropriate to allow card issuers to employ the general ability-to-pay standard, which permits the consideration of income to which the applicant has a reasonable expectation of access, to certain applicants who are under 21 and married, while applying the independent ability-to-pay standard to all applicants who are under 21 and not married.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Independent ability-to-pay standard.</em> As discussed above, the Bureau proposed several new comments that would have explained specifically how the independent ability-to-pay standard under § 1026.51(b)(1)(i) differs from the more general ability-to-pay standard in proposed § 1026.51(a). For example, proposed comment 51(b)(1)(i)-1.i would have provided that a card issuer may consider any current or reasonably expected income and assets of the consumer or consumers who are applying for a new account or will be liable for debts incurred on that account, including a cosigner or guarantor. In addition, proposed comment 51(b)(1)-1.i would have specified that when a card issuer is considering whether to increase the credit limit on an existing account, the card issuer may consider any current or reasonably expected income and assets of the consumer or consumers who are accountholders, cosigners, or guarantors and are liable for debts incurred on that account. Proposed comment 51(b)(1)(i)-1.i also would have noted that, because § 1026.51(b)(1)(i) requires that the consumer who has not attained the age of 21 have an independent ability to make the required minimum periodic payments, the card issuer may only consider the current or reasonably expected income and assets of an applicant or accountholder who is less than 21 years old under § 1026.51(b)(1)(i). In addition, proposed comment 51(b)(1)(i)-1.i would have noted that the card issuer may not consider income or assets to which an applicant, accountholder, cosigner, or guarantor, in each case who is under the age of 21 and is or will be liable for debts incurred on the account, has only a reasonable expectation of access under § 1026.51(b)(1)(i). Proposed comment 51(b)(1)(i)-1.ii would have provided examples of current or reasonably expected income and assets.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The final rule adopts comment 51(b)(1)(i)-1.i and .ii substantively as proposed, except that provisions in comment 51(b)(1)(i)-1.i relating to credit limit increases have been moved to comment 51(b)(2)-2, as discussed in more detail below. Several consumer groups suggested that the Bureau should clarify that student loan proceeds are not an applicant's current or reasonably expected income for purposes of the independent ability-to-pay standard in § 1026.51(b)(1)(i). These commenters referenced news articles that indicated that students are reporting a college loan as income and some card issuers are accepting that claim. These commenters indicated that, at a minimum, the Bureau should exclude any student loan proceeds up to the amount of the consumer's college tuition from being considered the applicant's current or reasonably expected income.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Based on careful consideration of the commenters' concerns, the final rule clarifies in comment 51(b)(1)(i)-1.ii that proceeds from student loans may be treated as current or reasonably expected income, provided that the card issuer only considers the loan proceeds remaining after tuition and other expenses have been disbursed to the applicant's educational institution. The Bureau believes that many students, particularly those in graduate programs, rely on student loan proceeds to finance their living expenses. The Bureau notes that the current rule does not specifically exclude student loan proceeds from being considered an applicant's current or reasonably expected income for purposes of the independent ability-to-pay standard in § 1026.51(b)(1)(i). And while the final rule permits consideration of certain student loan proceeds, § 1026.51(a)(1)(ii) also requires card issuers to establish and maintain reasonable written policies and procedures to consider a consumer's income or assets, and current debt. Thus, if a card issuer prompts a consumer to include, or otherwise has reason to know that a consumer has included, student loan proceeds as income on an application, it would be unreasonable for the card issuer not to exclude the portion of those proceeds that are unavailable to make payments on the account because they will be paid to the applicant's educational institution for tuition and other expenses.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 51(b)(1)(i)-1.iii would have explained that consideration of the income and assets of authorized users, household members, or other persons who are not liable for debts incurred on the account does not satisfy the requirement to consider the consumer's income or assets, unless a Federal or State statute or regulation grants a consumer who is liable for debts incurred on the account an ownership interest in such income and assets. Several industry commenters suggested that the Bureau revise proposed comment 51(b)(1)(i)-1.iii to refer specifically to community property laws as an example of a State statute or regulation that grants a consumer who is liable for debts incurred on the account an ownership interest in a non-applicant's income or assets.
        </analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The final rule adopts comment 51(b)(1)(i)-1.iii substantially as proposed with two clarifications. First, the final rule revises proposed comment 51(b)(1)(i)-1.iii to refer specifically to community property laws as discussed above. In addition, the final rule revises proposed comment 51(b)(1)(i)-1.iii to provide that a card issuer may consider a consumer's current or reasonably expected income to include any income of a person who is not liable for debts incurred on the account that is being deposited regularly into an account on which the consumer is an accountholder. The Bureau believes that such income may be considered the consumer's current or reasonably expected income, even though it is not the consumer's individual wages, because the income is being deposited regularly into the consumer's own account. The Bureau believes that these interpretations are consistent with the independent ability-to-pay standard set forth in TILA section 127(c)(8) because, in these circumstances, the applicant has a current or reasonably expected ownership interest in the non-applicant's income. As discussed below, the final rule also revises the examples in comment 51(b)(1)(i)-3 to be consistent with the revisions to comment 51(b)(1)(i)-1.iii.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 51(b)(1)(i)-2 generally would have provided interpretations on the sources of information on which a card issuer may rely for purposes of determining the consumer's current or reasonably expected income and assets under § 1026.51(b)(1)(i). For example, proposed comment 51(b)(1)(i)-2.i would have stated that card issuers may rely on information provided by applicants in response to a request for “salary,” “income,” “assets,” or other language requesting that the applicant provide information regarding current or reasonably expected income or assets. The proposed comment also would have provided, however, that card issuers may not rely solely on information provided in response to a request for “available income,” “accessible income,” or “household income.” Instead, the card issuer would have needed to obtain additional information about an applicant's income (such as by contacting the applicant).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis for § 1026.51(a), several industry commenters urged the Bureau to clarify that credit card issuers may rely on an applicant's stated income without additional inquiry or verification in response to a request for “salary,” “income,” “assets,” or other language requesting that the applicant provide information regarding current or reasonably expected income or assets. One commenter indicated that a consumer study conducted by it regarding the best way to ask consumers about income for purposes of the ability-to-pay determinations did not reveal a single most effective way to request income from applicants under 21 years of age, although a substantial number of consumer respondents found “personal income” and “individual income” to be clearest, but were confused by the meaning of the term “independent.”</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The final rule adopts comment 51(b)(1)(i)-2 as proposed with several revisions. The final rule revises proposed comment 51(b)(1)(i)-2.i to make clear that credit card issuers may rely on an applicant's stated income without further inquiry in response to a request for “salary,” “income,” “personal income,” “individual income,” “assets,” or other language requesting that the applicant provide information regarding his or her current or reasonably expected income or assets. As proposed and adopted, comment 51(b)(1)(i)-2.i also provides that card issuers may not rely solely on information provided in response to a request for “household income.” Nor may card issuers rely solely on information provided in response to a request for “available income,” “accessible income,” or other language prompting an applicant to provide income or assets to which the applicant only has a reasonable expectation of access. In those cases, the card issuer would need to obtain additional information about an applicant's current or reasonably expected income (such as by contacting the applicant). The final rule also revises proposed comment 51(b)(1)(i)-2.i to cross reference new comment 51(a)(1)-9, which clarifies that card issuers may use a single, common application form or process for all credit card applicants, regardless of age. See the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.51(a) for a discussion of comment 51(a)(1)-9.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.51(a), several consumer groups indicated that card issuers should be required to obtain some verification of whatever income source is relied upon. For the same reasons discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.51(a), the final rule does not require that card issuers verify the income information provided by an applicant under 21 on an application form, except under the circumstances discussed in comment 51(b)(1)(i)-2.i.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 51(b)(1)(i)-3 set forth four factual scenarios and explained how income would be treated in those scenarios pursuant to the independent ability-to-pay standard in § 1026.51(b)(1)(i). Specifically, proposed comment 51(b)(1)(i)-3.i provided that if a household member's salary is deposited into a joint account shared with the applicant, a card issuer may consider that salary to be the applicant's income for purposes of § 1026.51(b)(1)(i). Proposed comment 51(b)(1)(i)-3.ii discussed an example where the household member's salary is deposited into an account to which the applicant does not have access. However, the household member regularly transfers a portion of that salary into an account to which the applicant does have access, which the applicant uses for the payment of household or other expenses. Proposed comment 51(b)(1)(i)-3.ii would have clarified that whether a card issuer may consider the portion of the salary that is deposited into the account to be the applicant's income for purposes of § 1026.51(b)(1)(i) depends on whether a Federal or state Statute or regulation grants the applicant an ownership interest in the account to which the applicant has access. Proposed comment 51(b)(1)(i)-3.iii discussed an example where no portion of the household member's salary is deposited into an account to which the applicant has access. However, the household member regularly uses that salary to pay for the applicant's expenses. Proposed comment 51(b)(1)(i)-3 would have provided that under these circumstances a card issuer may not consider the household member's salary as the applicant's income for purposes of § 1026.51(b)(1)(i) because the salary is not current or reasonably expected income of the applicant. Proposed comment 51(b)(1)(i)-3.iv discussed an example where no portion of the household member's salary is deposited into an account to which the applicant has access, the household member does not regularly use that salary to pay for the applicant's expenses, and no Federal or State statute or regulation grants the applicant an ownership interest in that salary. Proposed comment 51(b)(1)(i)-3.iv would have provided that the card issuer may not consider the household member's salary to be the applicant's income for purposes of § 1026.51(b)(1)(i). The Bureau solicited comment on whether the examples set forth in proposed comment 51(b)(1)(i)-3 are appropriate, as well as on whether there are additional examples that should be included.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.51(a), several industry commenters requested that the Bureau make several clarifying revisions to comment 51(b)(1)(i)-3, such as making clear that the examples apply in situations where spouses or partners do not reside in the same physical location (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> military spouses, graduate students, elderly parents), and apply to “salary and other income” to address income that may come from a variety of sources such as Social Security benefits, veteran's benefits, retirement income, and investment income. One industry commenter also suggested that the proposed comment be revised to make clear that the examples in proposed comment 51(b)(1)(i)-3.i and .ii are examples of a consumer's current or reasonably expected income that may be considered by a card issuer in determining whether a consumer meets the independent ability-to-pay standard in § 1026.51(b)(1)(i).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The final rule adopts comment 51(b)(1)(i)-3 in substance as proposed, with several revisions to clarify the intent of the examples. As discussed above, the final rule revises comment 51(b)(1)(i)-1.iii to provide that consideration of the income and assets of authorized users, household members, or other persons who are not liable for debts incurred on the account does not satisfy the requirement to consider the consumer's current or reasonably expected income or assets, unless a Federal or State statute or regulation grants a consumer who is liable for debts incurred on the account an ownership interest in such income and assets (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> joint ownership granted under State community property laws), or such income is being deposited regularly into an account on which the consumer is an accountholder (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> an individual deposit account or a joint account).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The final rule revises the examples in comment 51(b)(1)(i)-3 to be more consistent with comment 51(b)(1)(i)-1.iii as adopted in the final rule, and to address concerns raised by commenters. As adopted in the final rule, the examples in comment 51(b)(1)(i)-3 demonstrate the general interpretations set forth in comment 51(b)(1)(i)-1.iii that a card issuer is permitted to consider a non-applicant's income to be the applicant's current or reasonably expected income for purposes of the independent ability-to-pay standard in § 1026.51(b)(1)(i) if the applicant has a current or reasonably expected ownership interest in the non-applicant's income, or the income is being deposited regularly into an account on which the applicant is an accountholder. However, a card issuer is not permitted to consider the non-applicant's income to be the applicant's current or reasonably expected income for purposes of the independent ability-to-pay standard in § 1026.51(b)(1)(i) when the applicant has only a reasonable expectation of access to the income.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Specifically, as adopted in the final rule, comment 51(b)(1)(i)-3 provides several examples assuming that an applicant is not employed and the applicant is under the age of 21 so § 1026.51(b) applies. Comment 51(b)(1)(i)-3.i provides that if a non-applicant's salary or other income is deposited regularly into a joint account shared with the applicant, a card issuer is permitted to consider the amount of the non-applicant's income that is being deposited regularly into the account to be the applicant's current or reasonably expected income for purposes of § 1026.51(b)(1)(i). This is because the non-applicant's income is being deposited regularly into an account on which the applicant is an accountholder.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Comment 51(b)(1)(i)-3.ii discusses an example where the non-applicant's salary or other income is deposited into an account to which the applicant does not have access, but the non-applicant regularly transfers a portion of that income into the applicant's individual deposit account. Comment 51(b)(1)(i)-3.ii provides that a card issuer is permitted to consider the amount of the non-applicant's income that is being deposited regularly into the applicant's individual deposit account to be the applicant's current or reasonably expected income for purposes of § 1026.51(b)(1)(i). Again, in this case, because the income is being deposited into an account on which the applicant is an accountholder, the card issuer is permitted to consider this income for purposes of the independent ability-to-pay standard under § 1026.51(b)(1)(i).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Comment 51(b)(i)-3.iii discusses an example where the non-applicant's salary or other income is deposited into an account to which the applicant does not have access; however, the non-applicant regularly uses that income to pay for the applicant's expenses. The comment provides that a card issuer is not permitted to consider the non-applicant's income that is used regularly to pay for the applicant's expenses as the applicant's current or reasonably expected income for purposes of § 1026.51(b)(1)(i), unless a Federal or State statute or regulation grants the applicant an ownership interest in such income. Although the applicant would have a reasonable expectation of access to the non-applicant's income that is being used regularly to pay for the applicant's expenses, the applicant does not have a reasonably expected ownership interest in such income unless a Federal or State statute or regulation grants the applicant an ownership interest in such income (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> joint ownership granted under State community property laws).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Comment 51(b)(1)(i)-3.iv discusses an example where the non-applicant's salary or income is deposited into an account to which the applicant does not have access, the non-applicant does not regularly use that income to pay for the applicant's expenses, and no Federal or State statute or regulation grants the applicant an ownership interest in that income. The comment provides that the card issuer is not permitted to consider the non-applicant's income to be the applicant's current or reasonably expected income for purposes of § 1026.51(b)(1)(i). In this case, the applicant does not have a reasonably expected ownership interest in the non-applicant's income.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Credit limit increases for consumers who are under 21.</em> Currently, § 1026.51(b)(2) addresses credit limit increases for young consumers. Specifically, § 1026.51(b)(2) prohibits credit line increases for accounts opened pursuant to § 1026.51(b)(1)(ii) unless the cosigner, guarantor, or joint accountholder liable on the account agrees in writing to accept liability for the line increase. Current comments 51(b)-1 and 51(b)(2)-1 provide clarification of this provision.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Section 1026.51(b)(2) does not expressly address credit limit increases for accounts opened under § 1026.51(b)(1)(i) (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> those based on the underage consumer's independent ability to pay). However, in proposed comment 51(b)(1)(i)-1.i, the Bureau clarified that “when a card issuer is considering whether to increase the credit limit on an existing account, the card issuer . . . may not consider income or assets to which an applicant, accountholder, cosigner, or guarantor, in each case who is under the age of 21 and is or will be liable for debts incurred on the account, has only a reasonable expectation of access” because “§ 1026.51(b)(1)(i) requires that the consumer who has not attained the age of 21 have an independent ability to make the required minimum periodic payments.” To remove any doubt that the independent ability-to-pay standard applies to credit line increases for accounts opened pursuant to § 1026.51(b)(1)(i), the final rule amends § 1026.51(b)(2) to provide in § 1026.51(b)(2)(i) that where a credit card account has been opened pursuant to § 1026.51(b)(1)(i), no increase in the credit limit may be made on such account before the consumer attains the age of 21 unless the consumer has an independent ability to make the required minimum periodic payments on the increased limit, consistent with § 1026.51(b)(1)(i), or a cosigner or similar party who is 21 or older agrees in writing to assume liability for any debt incurred on the account, consistent with § 1026.51(b)(1)(ii). The final rule clarifies that a card issuer may not consider income or assets to which an accountholder, cosigner, or guarantor who is under 21 and assumes liability for debts incurred on the account only has a reasonable expectation of access, but may consider income or assets to which the same category of individuals who have attained the age of 21 have a reasonable expectation of access. The final rule moves commentary on these credit limit increases from proposed comment 51(b)(1)(i)-1.i to comment 51(b)(2)-2. In addition, comment 51(b)(2)-2 provides that information regarding income and assets that satisfies the requirements of § 1026.51(b)(1)(i) also satisfies the requirements of § 1026.51(b)(2)(i)(A) and card issuers may rely on the guidance in the commentary to § 1026.51(b)(1)(i) for purposes of determining whether an accountholder who is less than 21 years old has the independent ability to make the required minimum periodic payments in accordance with § 1026.51(b)(2)(i)(A). Comment 51(b)(2)-2 further provides that information regarding income and assets that satisfies the requirements of § 1026.51(a) also satisfies the requirements of § 1026.51(b)(2)(i)(B) and card issuers may rely on the guidance in the commentary to § 1026.51(a)(1) for purposes of determining whether an accountholder who is 21 or older has the ability to make the required minimum periodic payments in accordance with § 1026.51(b)(2)(i)(B). The final rule also redesignates current § 1026.51(b)(2) as § 1026.51(b)(2)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to its authority under TILA section 105(a) and Section 2 of the Credit Card Act, the Bureau believes that it is necessary to clarify the applicability of the independent ability-to-pay standard to credit limit increases on accounts that were opened by consumers under the age of 21 without a cosigner or similar party who is 21 years or older, and where the consumers are still under the age of 21 at the time the credit limit increase is being considered, to prevent circumvention of the rules in § 1026.51(b)(1)(i). For example, if the ability-to-pay standard in § 1026.51(a)(1), as adopted in the final rule, applied to such credit limit increases, a card issuer could collect information about “accessible income” from the consumer who is younger than 21 years of age at application. While the card issuer could not rely on that income in meeting the independent ability-to-pay standard under § 1026.51(b)(1)(i) to open the credit card account for such consumer, the card issuer could consider this “accessible income” after account opening pursuant to § 1026.51(a)(1) and increase the credit limit on the account, even if the consumer remained under the age of 21 at the time. To prevent this type of circumvention, the final rule makes clear in § 1026.51(b)(2)(i)(A) that the independent ability-to-pay standard applies to credit limit increases on accounts that were opened by consumers under the age of 21 without a cosigner or similar party who is 21 years or older, and where the consumers are still under the age of 21 at the time the credit limit increase is being considered.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Current obligations.</em> Existing comment 51(a)(1)-5 provides that a card issuer may consider the consumer's current obligations based on information provided by the consumer or in a consumer report. In evaluating a consumer's current obligations, a card issuer need not assume that credit lines for other obligations are fully utilized. The Bureau proposed to renumber current comment 51(a)(1)-5 as comment 51(a)(1)-7. Several industry commenters indicated that the interpretations in proposed comment 51(a)(1)-7 also should apply to the consideration of the consumer's current obligations for purposes of § 1026.51(b)(1). The final rule adds comment 51(b)-5 to provide the same interpretations for considering the consumer's current obligations for purposes of § 1026.51(b)(1) and (2)(i), as adopted in comment 51(a)(1)-7.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Joint applicants or joint accountholders.</em> Existing comment 51(a)(1)-6 provides that with respect to the opening of a joint account for two or more consumers or a credit line increase on such an account, the card issuer may consider the collective ability of all persons who are or will be liable for debts incurred on the account to make the required payments. The Bureau proposed to renumber current comment 51(a)(1)-6 as comment 51(a)(1)-8. Several industry commenters indicated that the same interpretations in proposed comment 51(a)(1)-8 also should apply to the consideration of joint applications or joint accounts under § 1026.51(b)(1). Accordingly, the final rule adds comment 51(b)-6 to clarify that, with respect to the opening of a joint account for two or more consumers under § 1026.51(b)(1) or a credit line increase on such an account under § 1026.51(b)(2)(i), the card issuer may consider the collective ability of all persons who are or will be liable for debts incurred on the account to make the required payments. New comment 51(b)-6 also would cross-reference the commentary to § 1026.51(b)(1)(i) and § 1026.51(b)(2) for information on income and assets that may be considered for joint applicants, joint accountholders, cosigners, or guarantors who are under the age of 21, and the commentary to § 1026.51(b)(1)(ii) for information on income and assets that may be considered for joint applicants, joint accountholders, cosigners, or guarantors who are at least 21 years old.</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, a number of commenters requested that the Bureau clarify in the final rule that a card issuer's compliance with the amended ability-to-pay requirements does not violate ECOA and Regulation B. These commenters were concerned that absent an explicit safe harbor, card issuers would be subject to claims of potential violations of ECOA's and Regulation B's prohibition against discrimination based on age, sex, and marital status.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters requested that the Bureau clarify in the regulation or commentary, or at a minimum, the supplementary information to the final rule, that compliance with the stricter ability-to-pay requirement for consumers under the age of 21 does not give rise to age discrimination by an issuer under ECOA or Regulation B, since TILA section 127(c)(8), as implemented by § 1026.51(b), requires the distinction. To minimize the risk of potential claims of age-based discrimination, a few industry commenters urged the Bureau to apply the reasonable expectation of access criterion to all consumers, regardless of age. In addition, some commenters were concerned that the business decision to apply the independent ability-to-pay criterion to consumers age 21 or older may give rise to claims of potential discrimination based on sex. One commenter was concerned that the reasonable expectation of access criterion creates a potentially discriminatory practice based on marital status.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As stated above, the Bureau believes that TILA section 127(c)(8) requires the distinction in ability-to-pay requirements between consumers under the age of 21 and consumers age 21 or older. The Bureau agrees that a card issuer would not be in violation of ECOA or Regulation B merely by not considering income to which a consumer under the age of 21 only has a reasonable expectation of access (as it is prohibited from doing under TILA section 127(c)(8) as implemented by § 1026.51(b)), even though the card issuer may consider that income to be the consumer's income for consumers who are 21 or older. Accordingly, the final rule revises comment 51(b)(1)-1 to clarify that a card issuer would not violate Regulation B by virtue of complying with § 1026.51(b). The final rule also redesignates current comment 51(b)(1)-1 as comment 51(b)-7 and current comment 51(b)(1)-2 as comment 51(b)(1)-1 for organizational purposes.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As noted above, one trade association expressed concern that issuers who decide to use only the independent ability-to-pay criterion for applicants age 21 or older might risk violating ECOA and Regulation B—on the theory that doing so would disadvantage non-working spouses, who are likely to be predominantly female, while another industry commenter expressed concern that application of the reasonable expectation of access criterion may result in potential ECOA and Regulation B violations based on marital status. As discussed above, the final rule permits card issuers the flexibility to consider a consumer's ability to pay using the reasonable expectation of access criterion adopted in the final rule or instead using the independent ability-to-pay criterion. The Bureau recognizes that, depending on their business models, some card issuers may decide to use the independent ability-to-pay criterion. The Bureau understands that card issuers regularly make decisions about their tolerance for repayment risk and that such decisions are a proper and entirely appropriate consideration in crafting underwriting decisions. The final rule specifically provides flexibility on this point. The Bureau expects that card issuers will give careful consideration to how to use the discretion allowed under the rule's flexible approach, in light of the issuers' loss experiences, risk appetites, and other pertinent factors, including the potential effect of the decision on an ECOA protected class. The Bureau does not expect that issuers will necessarily have conducted a quantitative analysis in support of those decisions, but that they will be able to explain the reasoning that went into their decisions and the effects of those decisions. The Bureau is committed to engaging with stakeholders as they implement the new rule.</analysisParagraph>

            <analysisParagraph>As amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, TILA section 129D(a) contains the general requirement that an escrow account be established for any consumer credit transaction secured by a first lien on a consumer's principal dwelling. TILA section 129D(b), however, restricts that general requirement to four specified circumstances: (1) Where an escrow account is required by Federal or State law; (2) where the transaction is made, guaranteed, or insured by a State or Federal agency; (3) where the transaction's annual percentage rate exceeds the average prime offer rate by prescribed amounts; and (4) where an escrow account is “required pursuant to regulation.”</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Board's proposed § 226.45(b)(1) implemented only the third of the four circumstances, pursuant to TILA section 129D(b)(3), because the other three either are self-effectuating or are effectuated by other agencies' regulations. Nonetheless, the Bureau recognizes that those other three provisions may have implications for existing State and Federal credit programs, under which the applicable agencies may need to revise their own underlying guidelines to accommodate or otherwise reflect the statutory changes. Moreover, the Board's proposed § 226.45(b)(1) would have stated that, for purposes of § 226.45(b), “escrow account” has the same meaning as under Regulation X.

            <title>35(b)(3) Cancellation</title>
            <analysisParagraph>Under TILA section 129D(d), a creditor or servicer of a higher-priced mortgage loan must maintain an escrow account for a minimum of five years following consummation, unless the underlying debt obligation is terminated earlier under certain prescribed circumstances. In addition, even after five years have elapsed, TILA section 129D(d) provides that an escrow account shall remain in existence unless and until the consumer is current on the obligation and has accrued sufficient equity in the dwelling securing the consumer credit transaction “so as to no longer be required to maintain private mortgage insurance.”</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Board's proposed § 226.45(b)(3) would have implemented TILA section 129D(d) by permitting cancellation of the escrow account only upon the earlier of termination of the legal obligation or five years after consummation, provided that at least 20 percent of the original value of the property securing the underlying debt obligation is unencumbered and the consumer currently is not delinquent or in default on the underlying debt obligation. The Board modeled its proposal after the prerequisites for cancellation of private mortgage insurance coverage under the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998 (HPA), 12 U.S.C. 4901-4910. Under the HPA, the consumer may initiate cancellation of private mortgage insurance (PMI) once the outstanding balance of the mortgage obligation is first scheduled to reach 80 percent of the original value of the property, regardless of the outstanding balance, based on the amortization schedule or actual payments. In addition, servicers must automatically terminate PMI for residential mortgage transactions on the earliest date that the principal balance of the mortgage is first scheduled to reach 78 percent of the original value of the secured property securing the mortgage obligation, where the consumer is current. The Board sought comment on this proposal, as well as whether TILA section 129D(d)(1) should be interpreted narrowly to mean that, among consumers with escrow accounts required pursuant to proposed § 226.45(b)(1), only those that in fact have private mortgage insurance must meet the minimum equity requirement under the HPA as a prerequisite for cancelling their escrow accounts.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Commenters generally agreed with the Board's approach of requiring the 80 percent loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for consumer-requested PMI termination, rather than the 78 percent LTV ratio for automatic PMI termination. Several commenters remarked, however, that the proposed language defining the equity cancellation requirement as “at least 20% of the original value of the property securing the underlying debt obligation is unencumbered” was confusing, if not misleading.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The final rule follows the general approach in the Board's proposal by adopting § 1026.35(b)(3) to establish the cancellation criteria for escrow accounts as provided by TILA section 129D(d). In response to comments, § 1026.35(b)(3) contains revised language describing the equity necessary for cancellation as an unpaid principal balance that is less than 80 percent of the original value of the property securing the underlying debt obligation. Additionally, the Bureau is adopting the Board's proposed comment 45(b)(3)-1 as comment 35(b)(3)-1 to clarify that termination of the underlying credit obligation could include, among other things, repayment, refinancing, rescission, and foreclosure. Comment 35(b)(3)-2 clarifies that § 1026.35(b)(3) does not affect the right or obligation of a creditor or servicer, pursuant to the terms of the legal obligation or applicable law, to offer or require an escrow account after the minimum period dictated by § 1026.35(b)(3). Finally, comment 35(b)(3)-3 notes that the term “original value” in § 1026.35(b)(3)(ii)(A), as adopted from section 2(12) of the HPA, 12 U.S.C. 4901(12), means the lesser of the sales price reflected in the sales contract for the property, if any, or the appraised value of the property at the time the transaction was consummated.</analysisParagraph>

The Board's proposed § 226.45(b)(2)(ii) would have provided that insurance premiums need not be included in escrow accounts for transactions secured by dwellings in condominiums, planned unit developments (PUDs), or similar arrangements in which ownership requires participation in a governing association, where the governing association has an obligation to the dwelling owners to maintain a master policy insuring all dwellings.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Several commenters suggested that even with this expanded definition other ownership structures might not be captured by the Board's proposed exemption. The Bureau is responding to these comments by revising the proposed language to adopt the umbrella term “common interest community,” which one commenter had suggested would be sufficiently broad to capture the various arrangements under which a governing association has an obligation to the dwelling owners to maintain a master policy insuring all dwellings. The Bureau is adopting the Board's proposed comment 45(b)(2)(ii)-1 as comment 35(b)(2)(ii)-1, which parallels existing comment 35(b)(3)(ii)(B)-1, but with conforming amendments to reflect the expanded scope of the exemption. The Bureau also is adopting the Board's proposed comment 45(b)(2)(ii)-2 as comment A22b)(2)(ii)-2 to provide details about the nature of PUDs and to clarify that the exemption is available for not only condominiums and PUDs but also any other type of property ownership arrangement that has a governing association with an obligation to maintain a master insurance policy.

                  <title>“Operates Predominantly in Rural or Underserved Areas”</title>
                  <analysisParagraph>Under TILA section 129D(c)(1), to qualify for the exemption, a creditor must “operate predominantly in rural or underserved areas.” The Board's 2011 Escrows Proposal would have required a creditor to have made during the preceding calendar year more than 50 percent of its first-lien higher-priced mortgage loans in “rural or underserved” counties. One industry commenter agreed with the Board's proposal. Numerous commenters to the Board's proposal in this rule and the Board's 2011 ATR Proposal objected to the proposed definition of “rural or undeserved” as discussed below, but commenters did not generally dispute the definition of “predominantly” as meaning more than 50 percent of originations of its first-lien higher-priced mortgage loans in rural or underserved counties.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes Congress enacted the exemption in TILA section 129D(c)(1) to ensure access to credit in rural and underserved areas where consumers may be able to obtain credit only from community banks or other small creditors serving those areas. The “operates predominantly in” requirement serves to limit the exemption to these institutions. To remove this portion of the qualifications of the creditor would be to circumvent Congress's stated requirement that the exemption was intended for creditors operating predominantly in rural or underserved areas. The Bureau believes that “predominantly” indicates a portion greater than half, hence the regulatory requirement of more than 50 percent.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Upon further analysis of the differences in the proposals for the escrows exemption and the balloon-payment qualified mortgage provisions, however, the Bureau believes that further harmonization between the two sets of requirements is warranted. The Board's 2011 Escrows Proposal would have required creditors to track first-lien higher-priced mortgage loans by county, while the qualified mortgage proposal would have required creditors to track balloon-payment mortgages. Given that the underlying statutory language regarding “operates predominantly” is the same in each instance and that tracking each type of mortgage separately would increase administrative burden, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to base the threshold for both rules on the distribution of all first-lien “covered transactions” as defined in § 1026.43(b)(1). As provided in the 2013 ATR Final Rule, a covered transaction is defined in § 1026.43(b)(1) as a consumer credit transaction that is secured by a dwelling, as defined in § 1026.2(a)(19), other than a transaction exempt from coverage under § 1026.43(a). The Bureau believes that counting only first-lien transactions will facilitate compliance, as well as promote consistency in applying to creditors the two exemptions under both rulemakings, since both exemptions relate to first-lien transactions. Balloon-payment mortgages that will meet the qualifications of the balloon-payment qualified mortgage exemption will be first-lien covered transactions, as having subordinate financing along with the balloon-payment mortgage would be rare since it further constrains a consumers' ability to build equity in the property and to refinance the balloon-payment mortgage when it becomes due. Subordinate-lien, higher-priced mortgage loans are not required to establish escrow accounts, as only first-lien higher priced mortgage loans must establish escrow accounts under § 1026.35(b)(1).</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(A) provides that, during the preceding calendar year, a creditor must have made more than 50 percent of its total first-lien covered transactions in counties designated “rural” or “underserved” as defined by § 1026.35(b)(2)(iv), discussed below. Comment 35(b)(2)(iii)-1.i states that the Bureau publishes annually a list of counties that qualify as rural or underserved.</analysisParagraph>

                  <analysisParagraph>TILA section 129D(c)(3) provides that, to qualify for the exemption, a creditor together with its affiliates must have total annual mortgage originations that do not exceed a limit set by the Bureau. The Board's proposed § 226.45(b)(2)(iii)(B) required that the creditor and its affiliates, during either of the preceding two calendar years, have originated and retained servicing rights to 100 or fewer mortgage obligations secured by a first lien on real property or a dwelling. Although the Dodd-Frank Act requirement to establish escrow accounts applies only to higher-priced mortgage loans that are secured by first liens, the Board reasoned that it was appropriate to base the threshold on all first-lien originations because creditors are free to establish escrow accounts for all of their first-lien mortgages voluntarily to achieve the scale necessary to escrow cost-effectively. The Board estimated that a minimum servicing portfolio size of 500 is necessary to escrow cost-effectively, and assumed that the average life expectancy of a mortgage loan is about five years. Based on this reasoning, the Board believed that creditors would no longer need the benefit of the exemption if they originated and serviced more than 100 first-lien transactions per year. In contrast, the Board did not propose a specific annual originations threshold in connection with the balloon-payment qualified mortgages, but rather sought comment on whether to adopt a threshold based on the number of transactions or dollar volume and what numeric threshold would be appropriate.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>In connection with the Board's 2011 Escrows Proposal, trade association and industry commenters generally said that the proposed maximum annual volume of originations would be insufficient to make the escrow accounts cost effective for creditors. No commenters provided information to support their suggestions for alternative thresholds or to refute the Board's analysis that creditors can provide escrow accounts cost-effectively when they annually originate and retain servicing rights to more than 100 mortgage obligations secured by a first lien on real property or a dwelling. Suggestions for higher thresholds ranged from 200 to 1,000 mortgage obligations per year originated and serviced. One consumer advocacy commenter suggested the proposed threshold was too high because it counted only first-lien mortgage transactions, instead of all mortgage obligations, but offered no specific alternative amount. Two industry commenters also suggested that the origination limit should measure only the number of higher-priced mortgage loans originated and serviced by the creditor and its affiliates.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>In response to the Board's 2011 ATR Proposal, two trade associations and one group of State bank regulators, argued that other criteria, such as the asset-size limit or portfolio requirement, were sufficient and that neither a volume nor a total annual originations limit would be necessary. One industry trade association suggested combining the proposed alternatives and permitting creditors to elect under which limit they would operate. Other trade group and industry commenters indicated that the total annual originations limit would be preferable because of the varying dollar amount of transactions originated, which would constrain the number of consumers with limited credit options who could obtain balloon-payment mortgages in rural or underserved areas. Four trade group and industry commenters suggested a range for the total annual originations limit of 250 to 1,000 transactions.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that the requirement of TILA section 129D(c)(2) reflects a recognition that larger creditors have the systems capability and operational scale to establish cost-efficient escrow accounts. Similarly, the Bureau believes the requirement of TILA section 129C(b)(2)(E)(iv)(II) reflects Congress's recognition that larger creditors who operate in rural or underserved areas should be able to make credit available without resorting to balloon-payment mortgages. In light of the strong concerns expressed in both rulemakings about the potential negative impacts on small creditors in rural and underserved areas, the Bureau conducted further analysis to try to determine the most appropriate thresholds, although it was significantly constrained by the fact that data are limited with regard to mortgage originations in rural and underserved areas generally and in particular with regard to originations of balloon-payment mortgages.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau started with the premise that it would be preferable to use the same annual originations threshold in both rules to reflect the consistent language in both statutory provisions focusing on total annual mortgage loan originations, to facilitate compliance by not requiring institutions to track multiple metrics and to promote consistent application of the two exemptions. This approach requires significant reconciliation between the two proposals, however, because the escrows proposal focused specifically on transactions originated and serviced to gauge creditors' ability to maintain escrow accounts over time, while retention of servicing is not directly relevant to the balloon-payment qualified mortgage. However, to the extent that creditors chose to offer balloon-payment mortgages to manage their interest rate risk without having to undertake the compliance burdens involved in administering adjustable rate mortgages over time, the Bureau believes that both provisions are focused in a broad sense on accommodating creditors whose systems constraints might otherwise cause them to exit the market.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>With this in mind, the Bureau ultimately decided to adopt a threshold of 500 or fewer annual originations of first-lien transactions for both rules. The Bureau believes that this threshold will provide greater flexibility and reduce concerns that the specific threshold that had been proposed in the Board's 2011 Escrows Proposal (100 higher-priced mortgage loans originated and serviced annually in either of the preceding two years) would reduce access to credit by excluding creditors that need special accommodations in light of their capacity constraints. At the same time, the increase is not as dramatic as it may first appear because the Bureau's analysis of HMDA data suggests that even small creditors are likely to sell a significant number of their originations in the secondary market. Assuming that most mortgage transactions that are retained in portfolio are also serviced in house, the Bureau estimates that a creditor originating no more than 500 first-lien transactions per year would maintain and service a portfolio of about 670 mortgage obligations over time, assuming an average obligation life expectancy of five years.<footnote ref="33">A review of 2011 HMDA data shows creditors that otherwise meet the criteria of § 1026.43(f)(1)(vi) and originate between 200 and 500 or fewer first-lien covered transactions per year average 134 transactions per year retained in portfolio. Over a five year period, the total portfolio for these creditors would average 670 mortgage obligations.</footnote>
            Thus, the higher threshold will help to ensure that creditors that are subject to the escrow requirement do in fact maintain portfolios of sufficient size to maintain the escrow accounts on a cost efficient basis over time, in the event that the Board's estimate of a minimum portfolio of 500 transactions was too low. However, the Bureau believes that the 500 annual originations threshold in combination with the other requirements will still ensure that the balloon-payment qualified mortgage and escrow exemptions are available only to small creditors that focus primarily on a relationship-lending model and face significant systems constraints.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also believes that it is appropriate to focus the annual originations threshold on all first-lien originations. Given that escrow accounts are typically not maintained for transactions secured by subordinate liens, the Bureau does not believe that it makes sense to count such transactions toward the threshold because they would not contribute to a creditor's ability to achieve cost-efficiency. At the same time, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to count all first-lien transactions toward the threshold because creditors can voluntarily establish escrow accounts for such transactions to increase the cost-effectiveness of their program even though the mandatory account requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act apply only to first-lien, higher-priced mortgage loans. Focusing on all first-lien originations also provides a metric that is useful for gauging the relative scale of creditors' operations for purposes of the balloon-payment qualified mortgages, while focusing solely on the number of higher-priced mortgage loan originations would not. Accordingly, the Bureau adopts § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(B) requiring to creditor and its affiliates to have originated 500 or fewer covered transactions secured by a first lien.</analysisParagraph>

                  <title>Asset-Size Threshold</title>
                  <analysisParagraph>TILA section 129D(c)(4) provides that, to qualify for the exemption, a creditor must meet any asset-size threshold established by the Bureau. The Board's 2011 Escrows Proposal did not establish an asset-size threshold but did request comment on whether one should be added and, if so, what threshold level would be appropriate. In contrast, the Board proposed a $2 billion threshold for the balloon qualified mortgage exception. This number was based on the limited data available to the Board at the time of the proposal. Based on that limited information, the Board reasoned that none of the entities it identified as operating predominantly in rural or underserved areas had total assets as of the end of 2009 greater than $2 billion, and therefore, the limitation should be set at $2 billion. The Board expressly proposed setting the asset-size threshold at the highest level currently held by any of the institutions that appear to be smaller institutions that served areas with otherwise limited credit options.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>In response to the Board's 2011 Escrows Proposal, a group of State bank regulators and a trade association advocated including an asset-size prerequisite in the exemption. The group of State bank regulators suggested that the asset-size prerequisite be the sole requirement to obtain the exemption but did not propose a specific dollar threshold. The industry commenter suggested the asset-size be $1 billion in assets, but did not provide a rationale for the amount.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Based on the Board's 2011 ATR Proposal, one group of State bank regulators suggested that the asset-size threshold be included and be the only requirement for a creditor to qualify for the balloon-mortgage qualified mortgage exemption. Two trade association commenters suggested that a $2 billion asset-size threshold was appropriate, with one also suggesting that the asset-size threshold be the only requirement for a creditor to qualify for the balloon-payment qualified mortgage exemption. One industry commenter suggested that the asset-size threshold be $10 billion.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>For reasons discussed above, the Bureau is adopting an annual originations limit as contemplated by the statute. Given that limitation, restricting the asset size of institutions that can claim the exemption is of limited importance. Nonetheless, the Bureau believes that an asset-size limitation is still helpful because very large institutions should have sufficient resources to adapt their systems to make mortgages without a balloon payment and to establish and maintain escrow accounts even if the scale of their mortgage operations is relatively modest. A very large institution with a relatively modest mortgage operation also does not have the same type of reputational and balance-sheet incentives to maintain the same kind of relationship-banking model as a smaller community-based creditor. An asset-size limitation can guard against circumvention of the rule if a larger institution were to elect to enter a rural area to make a limited number of higher-priced mortgage loans or balloon-payment mortgages. Therefore, the Bureau believes that the $2 billion asset limitation proposed by the Board in the Board's 2011 ATR Proposal remains an appropriate limitation and should be adopted in both this final rule and the 2013 ATR Final Rule.<footnote ref="34">The $2 billion threshold reflects the purposes of the exemption and the structure of the mortgage servicing industry. The Bureau's choice of $2 billion in assets as a threshold for purposes of TILA section 129D(c)(4) does not imply that a threshold of that type or of that magnitude would be an appropriate way to distinguish small firms for other purposes or in other industries.</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, the Bureau adopts § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(C) to require creditors to have total assets as of the end of the preceding calendar year that are less than $2 billion and is effectively adopting the same threshold by cross-reference to § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) for purposes of the balloon-payment qualified mortgage exemption in the 2013 ATR Final Rule. As provided in § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(C), this threshold dollar amount will adjust automatically each year based on the year-to-year change in the average of the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), not seasonally adjusted, for each 12-month period ending in November, with rounding to the nearest million dollars. Comment 35(b)(2)(iii)-1.iii recites this initial threshold and further clarifies that a creditor that had total assets below the threshold on December 31 of the preceding year satisfies this criterion for purposes of the exemption during the current calendar year. The comment also notes that the Bureau will publish notice of each year's asset threshold by amending the comment.</analysisParagraph>

                  <title>Creditor and Affiliates Do Not Maintain Escrows</title>
                  <analysisParagraph>As adopted by section 1461 of the Dodd-Frank Act, TILA section 129D(c)(4) provides that, to qualify for the exemption, a creditor must meet any other criteria established by the Bureau consistent with the provisions of TILA. The Board's proposed § 226.45(b)(2)(iii)(C) would have required that, to obtain the exemption, the creditor and its affiliates not maintain an escrow account for any mortgage they currently service through at least such mortgage obligation's second installment due date. The Board used the second installment due date as a cutoff point because it recognized that a creditor may sometimes hold a mortgage obligation for a short period after consummation to take steps necessary before transferring and assigning the mortgage debt obligation to the intended investor. The Board recognized that the process of transferring and assigning the mortgage obligation could extend beyond the mortgage obligation's first payment due date, especially when the first payment is due shortly after consummation.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Board believed this additional condition was necessary to effectuate the purpose of the exemption. The Board reasoned that, if a creditor already establishes and maintains escrow accounts, it has the capacity to escrow and therefore has no need for the exemption. Moreover, the Board concluded that a creditor's capacity to escrow should reflect not only its own activities but those of any affiliate because it assumed that a creditor could rely on its affiliate to help meet the escrow requirement. The Board sought comment, however, on three aspects: first, whether affiliates' capacities to escrow should be considered; second, whether the second payment due date is the appropriate cutoff point for whether a creditor has established an escrow account for purposes of the exemption; and third, whether the proposal should allow some <em data-original="E-03">de minimis</em> number of mortgage obligations for which escrows are maintained and, if so, what that number should be.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Six trade association commenters, five industry commenters and a Federal agency submitted comments noting that many creditors had only begun to establish escrow accounts for mortgage transactions after the Board adopted the 2008 HOEPA Final Rule, which took effect for most transactions in April 2010. Many of the same commenters argued that it would be unfair to deny the exemption in TILA section 129D(c) to those creditors that established escrow accounts only to comply with the current escrow requirements. Two trade association commenters and one industry commenter suggested a <em data-original="E-03">de minimis</em> number of mortgage obligations ranging from 10 to 50 mortgage obligations to address the exclusion of creditors currently escrowing that would otherwise qualify for the exemption. In addition, one industry commenter suggested that a creditor that establishes escrow accounts for distressed mortgage obligations should still be eligible for the exemption, as these creditors are doing so as an accommodation to the consumer to attempt to avoid foreclosure. No comments were received as to whether the second payment due date is the appropriate cutoff point for whether a creditor has established an escrow account for purposes of the exemption.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting the Board's proposal in § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D), with the addition of two exceptions based on comments received. The Bureau agrees with the Board generally that creditors that currently provide escrow accounts can afford to establish and maintain escrow accounts for higher-priced mortgage loans. Thus, to qualify for the exemption, a creditor and its affiliates must not maintain escrow accounts for any extensions of consumer credit secured by real property or a dwelling that the creditor, or its affiliates, currently services through at least the second installment due date. However, the Bureau agrees with commenters that those creditors that would otherwise qualify for the exemption but for their compliance with the current regulation, and creditors that establish escrow accounts as an accommodation to distressed consumers, should still be able to qualify for the exemption in TILA section 129D(c). In particular, the Bureau notes that Congress's decision to codify and expand upon the escrow requirement from the 2008 HOEPA Final Rule while simultaneously providing authority to exempt certain mortgage transactions by creditors operating predominantly in rural or underserved areas suggests that Congress intended to provide relief to creditors that were struggling to meet the existing requirements. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) and (<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) to provide exceptions to the exemption's general prerequisite that a creditor and its affiliates not maintain an escrow account.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Comment 35(b)(2)(iii)-1.iv clarifies that the limitation excluding creditors and their affiliates who currently maintain escrow accounts for other mortgage obligations they service applies only to mortgage obligations serviced at the time a transaction purporting to invoke the escrows exemption is consummated. Thus, the exemption still could apply even if the creditor or its affiliates previously established and maintained escrows for mortgage obligations it no longer services. However, if a creditor or an affiliate escrows for mortgage obligations currently serviced, those institutions are ineligible to invoke the escrows exemption until the escrow accounts are no longer maintained. The comment also clarifies that a creditor or its affiliate “maintains” an escrow account for a mortgage obligation only if it services the mortgage obligation at least through the due date of the second periodic payment under the terms of the legal obligation.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Comment 35(b)(2)(iii)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>)-1 clarifies that escrow accounts created by a creditor and its affiliates established between April 1, 2010, and June 1, 2013 are not counted for purposes of § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D). In addition, the comment clarifies that creditors that continue to maintain escrow accounts that were established between April 1, 2010, and June 1, 2013 until the termination of those escrow accounts will still qualify for the exemption, so long as they or their affiliates do not establish escrow accounts for other mortgage obligations that the creditor and its affiliates service after June 1, 2013 and they otherwise qualify under § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii). Comment 35(b)(2)(iii)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>)-1 clarifies that escrow accounts established after consummation for distressed consumers are not considered to be maintaining escrow accounts for purposes of § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(D), although creditors that establish escrow accounts after consummation as a regular business practice are considered to be maintaining escrow accounts and cannot qualify for the exception under  § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) <em data-original="E-03">.</em>

              <title>35(b)(2)(iii)</title>
              <analysisParagraph>As adopted by Dodd-Frank Act section 1461, TILA section 129D(c) authorizes the Bureau to exempt from the higher-priced mortgage loan escrow requirement a creditor that: (1) Operates predominantly in rural or underserved areas; (2) together with all affiliates, has total annual mortgage loan originations that do not exceed a limit set by the Bureau; (3) retains its mortgage obligations in portfolio; and (4) meets any asset-size threshold and any other criteria as the Bureau may establish. As discussed above, Dodd-Frank Act section 1412 ability-to-repay provisions contain a similar set of criteria with regard to certain balloon-payment mortgages originated and held in portfolio by creditors that operate predominantly in rural or underserved areas. The statute authorizes the Bureau to issue regulations permitting certain balloon-payment mortgages issued by the specified creditors to receive a presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay requirements as “qualified mortgages,” even though the general qualified mortgage criteria prohibit balloon-payment features. Specifically, in addition to having to meet certain transaction-specific features and underwriting requirements, balloon-payment qualified mortgages may be made only by a creditor that: (1) Operates predominantly in rural or underserved areas; (2) together with all affiliates, has total annual residential mortgage transaction originations that do not exceed a limit set by the Bureau; (3) retains the balloon-payment mortgages in portfolio; and (4) meets any asset-size threshold and any other criteria as the Bureau may establish. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> TILA section 129C(b)(2)(E), 15 U.S.C. 1639c(b)(2)(E).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Board interpreted the two provisions as serving similar but not identical purposes, and thus varied certain aspects of the proposals to implement the balloon qualified mortgage and escrow provisions. Specifically, the Board interpreted the escrow provision as being designed to exempt creditors that do not possess economies of scale to offset cost-effectively the burden of establishing escrow accounts by maintaining a certain minimum portfolio size from being required to establish escrow accounts on higher-priced mortgage loans, and the balloon-payment qualified mortgage provision to ensure access to credit in rural and underserved areas where consumers may be able to obtain credit only from community banks offering balloon-payment mortgages. Accordingly, the two Board proposals would have used similar definitions of “rural” and “underserved,” but did not provide uniformity in calculating and defining various other elements. Specifically, the Board's proposed § 226.45(b)(2)(iii) would have implemented the escrow exemption in TILA section 129D(c) by requiring that the creditor have (1) in the prior year made more than 50 percent of its first-lien higher-priced mortgage loans in rural or underserved areas, (2) together with all affiliates, originated and retained servicing rights to no more than 100 first-lien mortgage obligations in either the current or prior calendar year, and (3) together with all affiliates, not maintained an escrow account on any consumer credit transaction secured by real property or a dwelling that is currently serviced by the creditor or its affiliates. The Board also sought comment on whether to add a requirement for the creditor to meet an asset-size limit and what that size should be.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In contrast, the Board's proposal for balloon qualified mortgages would have required that the creditor (1) in the preceding calendar year, have made more than 50 percent of its balloon-payment mortgages in rural or underserved areas; and (2) have assets that did not exceed $2 billion. The Board proposed two alternatives for qualifications relating to (1) the total annual originations limit; and (2) the retention of balloon-payment mortgages in portfolio.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In both cases, the Board proposed to use a narrow definition of rural based on the Economic Research Service (ERS) of the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) “urban influence codes” (UICs). The UICs are based on the definitions of “metropolitan” and “micropolitan” as developed by the Office of Management and Budget, along with other factors reviewed by the ERS that place counties into twelve separately defined UICs depending on the size of the largest city and town in the county. The Board's proposal would have limited the definition of rural to certain “non-core” counties, which are areas outside of any metropolitan or micropolitan area, excluding those adjacent to a metropolitan area of at least one million residents or adjacent to a micropolitan area with a town of at least 2,500 residents. This definition corresponded with UICs of 7, 10, 11, and 12, which would have covered areas in which only 2.3 percent of the nation's population lives.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In light of the overlap in criteria between the escrow exemption and balloon qualified mortgage provisions, the Bureau considered comments responding to both proposals in determining how to finalize the particular elements of each rule as discussed further below. With regard to exercising the Bureau's authority to create an escrows exemption in general, the bulk of the comments received asserted that the Bureau should exercise such authority but that the scope of the proposal was too limited and would lead to reduced access to credit or increased costs for consumers in rural areas because of increased compliance costs for creditors. Two industry commenters suggested a blanket exemption for community banks, but did not identify any criteria to define a community bank. Five industry commenters suggested the exemption should be based solely on loan-to-value ratio of the transaction being originated, ranging from 50 percent to 80 percent, without using any of the statutory requirements. Four trade association commenters suggested that the exemption should be based solely on whether the debt obligation was being kept in the creditor's portfolio. One consumer advocacy group stated that the exemption was too broad because, under its reading of section 1461 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the exemption was not meant to protect access to credit but, rather, to protect communities that need credit but cannot find credit with terms better than the terms of higher-priced mortgage loans.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that escrows generally provide meaningful consumer protections, as consumers may not incorporate recurring costs related to the ownership of a dwelling to their monthly mortgage payments to anticipate the total costs associated with the dwelling. For consumers who struggle with their monthly mortgage payments, there is a higher probability of foreclosure as a result. Based on recent research,<footnote ref="29">Nathan B. Anderson and Jane B. Dokko, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Liquidity Problems and Early Payment Default Among Subprime Mortgages,&lt;/em&gt; Finance and Economics Discussion Series, Federal Reserve Board (2011), available at: &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2011/201109/201109pap.pdf.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>
            consumers that do not have an escrow account in the first year after consummation result in 0.35 percent more foreclosures per year for first-lien, higher-priced mortgages. However, in rural and underserved areas where there are fewer creditors that may be willing to extend higher-priced mortgage loans, the number of providers could be further reduced when additional costs associated with establishing and maintaining escrow accounts are taken into account. The reduction in the number of providers could lead to some consumers being unable to obtain higher-priced mortgage loans, or to increase the costs of the higher-priced mortgage loans as a result of a concentrated market with limited competition to a point where the consumer would be unable to repay the higher-priced mortgage loan.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>There are also substantial data suggesting that the small portfolio creditors that are most likely to have difficulty maintaining escrow accounts (or to rely on balloon loan transactions to manage their interest rate risks) have a significantly better track record than larger creditors with regard to the performance of their mortgage transactions. As discussed in more depth in the 2013 ATR Concurrent Proposal, because small portfolio creditors retain a higher percentage of their transactions on their own books, they have strong incentives to engage in thorough underwriting. To minimize performance risk, small community creditors have developed underwriting standards that differ from those employed by larger institutions. Small creditors generally engage in “relationship banking,” in which underwriting decisions rely at least in part on qualitative information gained from personal relationships between creditors and consumers. This qualitative information focuses on subjective factors such as consumer character and reliability which “may be difficult to quantify, verify, and communicate through the normal transmission channels of banking organization.”<footnote ref="30">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Allen N. Berger and Gregory F. Udell, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Small Business Credit Availability and Relationship Lending: The Importance of Bank Organizational Structure,&lt;/em&gt; Economic Journal (2002).</footnote>
            While it is not possible to disaggregate the impact of each of the elements of the community banking model, the combined effect is highly beneficial. Moreover, where consumers have trouble paying their mortgage obligations, small portfolio creditors have stronger incentives to work with the consumers to get them back on track, to protect both the creditors' balance sheets and their reputations in their local communities. Market-wide data demonstrate that mortgage delinquency and charge-off rates are significantly lower at smaller banks than at larger banks.<footnote ref="31">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 2013 ATR Concurrent Proposal; FDIC, Community Banking Study, December 2012, available at: &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/resources/cbi/report/cbi-full.pdf.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>

              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that Congress carefully weighed these considerations in authorizing the Bureau to establish an exemption in TILA section 129D(c) to ensure access to credit in rural and underserved areas where consumers may be able to obtain credit only from community banks that cannot maintain escrow accounts on a cost-effective basis. Thus, the Bureau concludes that exercising its authority is appropriate, but also that the exemption should implement the statutory criteria to ensure it effectuates Congress's intent. Accordingly, as discussed in more detail below, the Bureau is adopting § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) largely as proposed, but with certain changes described below, to implement TILA section 129D(c).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In particular, the Bureau has concluded that it is appropriate to make the specific creditor qualifications much more consistent between the balloon-payment qualified mortgage and escrow exemptions than originally proposed by the Board.<footnote ref="32">The Bureau has similarly attempted to maintain consistency between the asset-size limit, annual originations threshold, and requirements concerning portfolio transactions as between the final rules that it is adopting with regard to balloon qualified mortgages and the escrow exemption and its separate proposal to create a new type of qualified mortgage originated and held by small portfolio creditors. The Bureau is seeking comment in that proposal on these elements and on whether other adjustments are appropriate to the existing rules to maintain continuity and reduce compliance burden. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; the 2013 ATR Concurrent Proposal.</footnote>
            The Bureau believes that this approach is justified by several considerations, including the very similar statutory language, the similar congressional intents underlying the two provisions, and the fact that requiring small creditors operating predominantly in rural or underserved areas to track overlapping but not identical sets of technical criteria for each separate provision could create unwarranted compliance burden that itself would frustrate the intent of the statutes. Although the Bureau has recast and loosened some of the criteria to promote consistency, the Bureau has carefully calibrated the changes to further the purpose of each rulemaking. Further, the Bureau believes that any risk to consumers from the modifications is minimal given the nature of the small creditors' operations and in particular the fact that they are required to hold the affected transactions in portfolio (in this final rule's case, indirectly, by virtue of the requirement that a transaction originated under the escrow exemption not be subject to a forward commitment at consummation). As discussed in more detail below and in the 2013 ATR Concurrent Proposal, which also proposes to adopt several of the criteria to define a new type of qualified mortgage, the creditors at issue have strong motivations to provide vigorous underwriting and high levels of customer service to protect their balance sheets and reputations in their local communities. This motivation is manifest in the fact that they have demonstrably lower credit losses on their mortgage originations than larger institutions.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>For the foregoing reasons, the Bureau is adopting § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) to implement TILA section 129D(c) by providing that a transaction is exempt from the escrow account requirement otherwise applicable to a higher-priced mortgage loan if the creditor: (1) In the preceding calendar year made more than 50 percent of its first-lien covered transactions in counties designated by the Bureau as “rural” or “underserved”; (2) together with all affiliates extended 500 or fewer first-lien covered transactions in the preceding calendar year; and (3) has total assets that are less than $2 billion, adjusted annually for inflation. The final rule also creates greater parallelism with the balloon qualified mortgage provision with regard to the requirement that the affected transactions be held in portfolio by requiring in both rules that the transactions not be subject to a “forward commitment” agreement at the time of consummation. These qualifications and the other requirements under the final rule are discussed in more detail below.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>“Rural” and “Underserved” Defined</title>
                <analysisParagraph>As adopted in the Dodd-Frank Act, TILA section 129D(c)(1) requires, among other criteria for the escrows exemption, that the creditor operate predominantly in “rural” and “underserved” areas, but does not define either term. As discussed above, the Board proposed separate definitions for “rural” and “underserved,” respectively, in both the Board's 2011 Escrows Proposal and the 2011 ATR Proposal, and the definitions for the two terms were similar across the two proposals.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Commenters on the two proposals addressed the specific definitions themselves but not the necessity of creating a definition for “rural” that is separate from “underserved.” The Bureau is adopting the Board's approach in § 1026.35(b)(2)(iv) which establishes a definition of rural that is separate from underserved. Thus, creditors' activity in either type of area will count toward their eligibility for the escrows exemption and for making balloon-payment qualified mortgages.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">“Rural.”</em> As described above, the Board's proposed definition of rural for purposes of both the balloon-payment qualified mortgage and escrows exemptions would have relied upon the ERS's “urban influence codes” (UICs), which in turn are based on the definitions of “metropolitan statistical area” and “micropolitan statistical area.”<footnote ref="35">The ERS places counties into twelve separately defined UICs depending on the size of the largest city or town in the county or in adjacent counties. Descriptions of UICs can be found on the ERS Web site at &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/urban-influence-codes/documentation.aspx.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>

            The Board's proposal would have limited the definition of rural to certain “non-core” counties, which are areas outside of any metropolitan or micropolitan area that are not adjacent to a metropolitan area with at least one million residents or to a micropolitan area with a town of at least 2,500 residents. This definition corresponded to UICs 7, 10, 11, and 12. The counties that would have been covered under the Board's proposed definition contain 2.3 percent of the United States population under the 2000 census. The Board believed this approach limited the definition of “rural” to those properties most likely to have only limited sources of mortgage credit because of their remoteness from urban centers and their resources. However, the Board sought comment on all aspects of this approach to defining rural, including whether the definition should be broader or narrower or based on information other than UIC codes.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Many commenters to both the 2011 ATR Proposal and the 2011 Escrows Proposal, including more than a dozen trade group commenters, several individual industry commenters, one association of State banking regulators, and a United States Senator, stated that the rural definition was too narrow. The trade association and industry commenters, and the group of State banking regulators, had various proposals to broaden the definition, from the addition of other UICs and a combination of county population and asset size to the adoption of other regulatory definitions of “rural,” such as those governing credit unions. The comment from a United States Senator suggested using the eligibility of a property to secure a single-family mortgage under the USDA's Rural Housing Loan program as the definition of a rural property.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees that a broader definition of “rural” is appropriate to ensure access to credit with regard to both the escrows and balloon-payment qualified mortgage exemptions. In particular, the Bureau believes that all “non-core” counties should be encompassed in the definition of rural, including counties adjacent to a metropolitan area of at least one million residents or a county with a town of at least 2,500 residents (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> counties with a UIC of 4, 6, or 9 in addition to the counties with the UICs included in the Board's definition). The Bureau also believes that micropolitan areas that are not adjacent to a metropolitan area should be included within the definition of rural (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> counties with a UIC of 8), as these areas are not located adjacent to metropolitan areas that are served by many creditors. These counties have significantly fewer creditors originating higher-priced mortgage loans and balloon-payment mortgages than other counties.<footnote ref="36">A review of data from HMDA reporters indicates that there were 700 creditors in 2011 that otherwise meet the requirements of new § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii), of which 391 originate higher-priced mortgage loans in counties that meet the definition of rural, compared to 2,110 creditors that otherwise meet the requirements of § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) that originate balloon-payment mortgages in counties that would not be rural. The 391 creditors originated 12,921 higher-priced mortgage loans, representing 30 percent of their 43,359 total mortgage loan originations. A review of data from credit unions indicates that there were 830 creditors in 2011 that otherwise meet the requirements of § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii), of which 415 originate balloon-payment and hybrid mortgages in counties that meet the definition of rural, compared to 3,551 creditors that otherwise meet the requirements of § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) that originate balloon-payment mortgages in counties that would not be rural. The 415 creditors originated 4,980 balloon-payment mortgage originations, representing 20 percent of their 24,968 total mortgage loan originations.</footnote>
            Including these counties within the definition of rural would result in 9.7 percent of the U.S. population being located within rural areas. Under this definition, only counties in metropolitan areas or in micropolitan areas adjacent to metropolitan areas would be excluded from the definition of rural.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also considered adopting the definition of rural used to determine the eligibility of a property to secure a single-family mortgage under the USDA's Rural Housing Loan program. This definition subdivides counties into rural and non-rural areas based upon whether certain areas are open country, or contain a town, village, city or place, with certain population criteria, and excludes areas associated with an urban area. Given the size of some counties, particularly in western States, this approach may provide a more nuanced measure of access to credit in some areas than a county-by-county metric. However, use of the Rural Housing Loan metrics would incorporate such significant portions of metropolitan and micropolitan counties that 37 percent of the United States population would be within areas defined as rural. Based on a review of HMDA data and the location of mortgage transactions originated by HMDA reporting entities, the average number of creditors in the areas that would meet the USDA's Rural Housing Loan program definition of rural is ten. The Bureau believes that a wholesale adoption of the Rural Housing Loan definitions would therefore expand the definition of rural beyond the intent of the escrow and balloon-payment qualified mortgage exemptions under sections 1412 and 1461 of the Dodd-Frank Act by incorporating areas in which there is robust access to credit.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, the final rule implements § 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A) to provide that a county is rural if it is neither in a metropolitan statistical area, nor in a micropolitan statistical area that is adjacent to a metropolitan statistical area. The Bureau intends to continue studying over time the possible selective use of the Rural Housing Loan program definitions and tools provided on the USDA Web site to determine whether a particular property is located within a “rural” area. For purposes of initial implementation, however, the Bureau believes that defining “rural” to include more UIC categories creates an appropriate balance to preserve access to credit and create a system that is easy for creditors to implement.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">“Underserved.”</em> The Board's proposed § 226.45(b)(2)(iv)(B) would have defined a county as “underserved” during a calendar year if no more than two creditors extend credit secured by a first lien on real property or a dwelling five or more times in that county. The definition was based on the Board's judgment that, where no more than two creditors are significantly active, the inability of one creditor to offer a higher-priced mortgage loan would be detrimental to consumers who would have limited credit options because only one creditor, or no creditors, would be left to provide the higher-priced mortgage loan. Essentially, a consumer who could only qualify for a higher-priced mortgage loan would be required to obtain credit from the remaining creditor in that area or would be left with no credit options at all. Most of the same commenters that stated that the proposed definition of rural was too narrow, as discussed above, also stated that this definition of underserved was too narrow. The commenters proposed various different standards, including standards that considered the extent to which the property was in a rural area, as an alternate definition of underserved.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with the Board that the purpose of the exemption is to permit creditors to continue to offer credit to consumers, rather than to refuse to make higher-priced mortgage loans if such creditors' withdrawal would significantly limit consumers' ability to obtain mortgage credit. In light of this rationale, the Bureau believes that “underserved” should be implemented in a way that protects consumers from losing meaningful access to mortgage credit and that it is appropriate to focus the definition on identifying areas where the withdrawal of a creditor from the market could leave no meaningful competition for consumers' mortgage business. The Bureau notes that the final rule's expanded definition of “rural,” as discussed above, will also address concerns about access to credit in many areas. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting § 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(B) to define a property as “underserved” if it is located in a county where no more than two creditors extend covered transactions secured by a first lien five or more times in that county during a calendar year, substantially consistent with the Board's proposal. As adopted, § 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(B) also expressly states that the numbers of creditors and of their originations in counties for purposes of this definition is as reported in HMDA data for the year in question.
          </analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau adopted this definition based on HMDA data to provide an objective, easily administered rule and one that is consistent with the purpose of preserving credit access in underserved areas. Given that many smaller creditors may not be subject to HMDA reporting requirements, the Bureau recognizes that many counties may be underserved under the definition being adopted, because it is based on HMDA data, yet additional information (if it were available) could reveal that more than two creditors are significantly active in such counties. The Bureau may examine further whether a refinement to the underserved definition is warranted.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Commentary guidance on “rural” and “underserved” definitions.</em> Comment 35(b)(2)(iv)-1 clarifies that the Bureau will annually update on its Web site a list of counties deemed rural or underserved under the definitions of rural and underserved in § 1026.35(b)(2)(iv). It also clarifies that the definition of rural corresponds to UICs 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12, as determined by the Economic Research Service of the USDA. It further clarifies that the definition of underserved counties is based on HMDA data. Finally, the comment provides that the Bureau also publishes a list of only those counties that are rural but not also underserved, to facilitate compliance with § 1026.35(c).<footnote ref="37">Section 1026.35(c) is being adopted separately by the Bureau jointly with other Federal agencies, to implement the new appraisal requirements in TILA section 129H, in the 2013 Interagency Appraisals Final Rule, as discussed in part III.C, above. That new section provides an exemption for creditors operating in rural, but not underserved, areas. Consequently, the single, combined list of all counties that are either rural or underserved that the Bureau will publish annually for purposes of the exemption from this final rule's escrow requirement is inadequate for the analogous purpose under the new appraisal requirements in § 1026.35(c).</footnote>
            As this final rule takes effect on June 1, 2013, the Bureau expects to publish lists applicable for the current year within approximately four to six weeks after publication of this final rule, but in any event before this final rule takes effect.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>35(b)(2)(v)</title>
              <analysisParagraph>As established by the Dodd-Frank Act, TILA section 129D(c)(3) requires that the exemption from the escrow requirements apply only where a creditor “retains its mortgage loan originations in portfolio” and meets the other statutory requirements. Because the escrow requirements must be applied at the time that a transaction is consummated, while qualified mortgage status may continue for the life of the mortgage obligation, the Board did not propose to implement this requirement consistently with the 2011 ATR Proposal. The Board's proposed § 226.45(b)(2)(v) would have provided that the escrow exemption is not available for certain transactions that, at consummation, are subject to “forward commitments.” Forward commitments are agreements entered into at or before consummation of a transaction under which a purchaser is committed to acquire the mortgage obligation from the creditor after consummation. In addition, the Board included a proposed comment to § 226.45(b)(2)(v) which would have clarified that the forward commitment provision would have applied whether the forward commitment refers to the specific transaction or the higher-priced mortgage loan meets prescribed criteria of the forward commitment in order to address a potential method to avoid compliance. The Board's 2011 ATR Proposal, in contrast, proposed two alternatives for comment, either prohibiting a creditor to qualify if it has sold any balloon-payment qualified mortgages at any time or prohibiting a creditor to qualify if it has sold any balloon-payment qualified mortgages in the current or prior calendar year.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Board considered requiring that a transaction be held in portfolio after consummation as a condition of the escrows exemption, but concluded that this approach would have raised operational problems. Whether a mortgage obligation is held in portfolio can be determined only after consummation, but a creditor making a higher-priced mortgage loan must know by consummation whether it is subject to the escrow requirement. The Board expressed concern that requiring an escrow account to be established sometime after consummation if the creditor in fact sells the mortgage obligation could put a significant burden on consumers, who may not have the money available to make a significant advance payment. In contrast, the Board reasoned that the forward commitment test would be easy to apply at consummation, and would be unlikely to be circumvented by small creditors because they would be reluctant to extend credit for transactions they do not intend to keep in portfolio unless they have the assurance of a committed buyer before extending the credit. Thus, proposed § 226.45(b)(2)(v) would have served as a means of indirectly limiting the exemption to mortgage obligations that are to be held in portfolio. The Board sought comment, however, on whether institutions could easily evade the escrow requirement by making higher-priced mortgage loans without a forward commitment in place and thereafter selling them to non-exempt purchasers and how to address this possibility without relying on post-consummation events.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Among the commenters, there was a divergence of opinion on how this provision would work in practice. One trade association commenter stated that the forward commitment requirement would prevent creditors from selling portfolio mortgage obligations in the future. This appears to be a misreading of the Board's proposal, as it would not have restricted the sale of higher-priced mortgage loans. The Board's proposed § 226.45(b)(2)(v) instead merely provided that, so long as the higher-priced mortgage loan was not subject to a forward commitment at the time of consummation, the higher-priced mortgage loan could later be sold on the secondary market without requiring an escrow account to be established at that time. One consumer advocacy group, concerned about the possibility that creditors would use the provision to skirt the escrow requirements, suggested a blanket rule that higher-priced mortgage loans that are exempt must be maintained in the portfolio of the creditor or, alternatively, that upon sale secondary market purchasers be required to establish escrow accounts for such mortgage obligations.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>After reviewing the comments received, the Bureau believes that the Board's proposal is an appropriate method to implement the requirements of TILA section 129D(c)(3), as both creditor and consumer benefit if an escrow account is established at consummation of the transaction, rather than months or years later. Indeed, allowing a consumer to avoid having to make a single large lump-sum payment after consummation is part of the basic purpose of establishing an escrow account. Accordingly, the Bureau is following the approach in the Board's proposal by adopting § 1026.35(b)(2)(v) to require that for a higher-priced mortgage loan to be exempt from the requirements under § 1026.35(b)(1), the higher-priced mortgage loan must not be subject to a forward commitment to be acquired by a creditor that does not satisfy the conditions of § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii). Comment 35(b)(2)(v)-1 clarifies that a higher-priced mortgage loan that is subject to a forward commitment is subject to the escrow requirement under § 1026.35(b)(1), whether the forward commitment refers to the specific transaction or the higher-priced mortgage loan meets prescribed criteria of the forward commitment, along with an example. As discussed separately in the Bureau's 2013 ATR Final Rule, the Bureau is also adopting language in § 1026.43(f) to provide that qualified mortgage status is not available to balloon-payment mortgages that would otherwise qualify for the exemption if the transactions are subject to a forward commitment at the time of consummation.</analysisParagraph>

            <title>35(b)(2) Exemptions</title>
            <analysisParagraph>Under existing regulations, certain categories of transactions are exempt from the escrow requirement. The Board proposed § 226.45(a)(3) and (b)(2)(i) and (ii) to reflect these provisions. The Board's proposed § 226.45(a)(3) would have provided that a “higher-priced mortgage loan” does not include a transaction to finance the initial construction of a dwelling, a temporary or “bridge” transaction with a term of twelve months or less, a reverse mortgage transaction, or a home equity line of credit. This provision is identical to existing § 1026.35(a)(3) (adopted as § 226.35(a)(3) in the 2008 HOEPA Final Rule), which provides that the term “higher-priced mortgage loan” does not include a transaction to finance the initial construction of a dwelling, a temporary or “bridge” transaction with a term of twelve months or less, a reverse mortgage transaction, or a home equity line of credit. The Board's proposed § 226.45(b)(2)(i) would have provided that escrow accounts need not be established for transactions secured by shares in a cooperative. This provision would track existing § 1026.35(b)(3)(ii)(A). It also is consistent with new TILA section 129D(e), as added by section 1461 of the Dodd-Frank Act.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In light of the way in which the Dodd-Frank Act has expanded on various elements of the 2008 HOEPA Final Rule, the Bureau believes that a more tailored approach is appropriate to specify what types of transactions are exempt from specific substantive requirements in Regulation Z. Accordingly, with the exception of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), the Bureau is using its exemption authority under TILA section 129D<footnote ref="25">The Bureau may prescribe rules that revise, add to, or subtract from the criteria of section 129D(b) of TILA if the Bureau determines that such rules are in the interest of consumers and the public interest. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 15 U.S.C. 1639d note. These exceptions are also justified by section 105(a) of TILA which provides that the Bureau in its regulations to carry out the purposes of TILA may provide for such adjustments and exceptions for all or any class of transactions that the Bureau judges are necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of TILA, to prevent circumvention or evasion thereof, or to facilitate compliance therewith. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 15 U.S.C. 1604(a).</footnote>
            to recodify the exemptions that were formerly located in § 1026.35(a)(3) and § 1026.35(b)(3)(ii)(A) in the exemptions from coverage of the escrow requirement under new § 1026.35(b)(2). The separate exemption for HELOCs is no longer necessary because § 1026.35(a)(1) has been modified to apply only to closed-end consumer credit transactions.<footnote ref="26">The Bureau notes that open-end credit transactions are excluded from section 129D(a) of TILA under Dodd-Frank Act section 1461. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 15 U.S.C. 1639d.</footnote>
            The Bureau believes that the use of its exemption authority is appropriate given the nature of the transactions at issue and would benefit consumers and industry alike. Given that reverse mortgages are unique transactions that are currently addressed by § 1026.33,<footnote ref="27">Reverse mortgages are also excluded from section 129D(a) of TILA under Dodd-Frank Act section 1461. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 15 U.S.C. 1639d.</footnote>
            the Bureau believes it is in the interest of consumers and the public interest to pursue a course involving further review of § 1026.33 and to consider whether new or different protections would be appropriate for reverse mortgages at a later date.<footnote ref="28">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Reverse Mortgages: Report to Congress&lt;/em&gt; (June 28, 2012) available at: &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://files.consumerfinance.gov/a/assets/documents/201206_cfpb_Reverse_Mortgage_Report.pdf.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>

            In addition, because of the nature of construction-only and bridge loan transactions, the Bureau believes that exempting these transactions is in the interest of consumers and the public interest. In both cases, the payments and amounts of property taxes and hazard insurance will depend on various time-sensitive factors for loan transactions that generally do not exist for more than one or two years, making maintaining an escrow account for a minimum of five years impractical. The recodification of the other exemptions from the escrows requirements is purely for organizational purposes and has no substantive effect. Exemptions from the new appraisal requirements are being finalized separately by the 2013 Interagency Appraisals Final Rule, in § 1026.35(c).</analysisParagraph>

            <analysisParagraph>As established by the Dodd-Frank Act, TILA section 129D(c)(3) requires that the exemption from the escrow requirements apply only where a creditor “retains its mortgage loan originations in portfolio” and meets the other statutory requirements. Because the escrow requirements must be applied at the time that a transaction is consummated, while qualified mortgage status may continue for the life of the mortgage obligation, the Board did not propose to implement this requirement consistently with the 2011 ATR Proposal. The Board's proposed § 226.45(b)(2)(v) would have provided that the escrow exemption is not available for certain transactions that, at consummation, are subject to “forward commitments.” Forward commitments are agreements entered into at or before consummation of a transaction under which a purchaser is committed to acquire the mortgage obligation from the creditor after consummation. In addition, the Board included a proposed comment to § 226.45(b)(2)(v) which would have clarified that the forward commitment provision would have applied whether the forward commitment refers to the specific transaction or the higher-priced mortgage loan meets prescribed criteria of the forward commitment in order to address a potential method to avoid compliance. The Board's 2011 ATR Proposal, in contrast, proposed two alternatives for comment, either prohibiting a creditor to qualify if it has sold any balloon-payment qualified mortgages at any time or prohibiting a creditor to qualify if it has sold any balloon-payment qualified mortgages in the current or prior calendar year.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Board considered requiring that a transaction be held in portfolio after consummation as a condition of the escrows exemption, but concluded that this approach would have raised operational problems. Whether a mortgage obligation is held in portfolio can be determined only after consummation, but a creditor making a higher-priced mortgage loan must know by consummation whether it is subject to the escrow requirement. The Board expressed concern that requiring an escrow account to be established sometime after consummation if the creditor in fact sells the mortgage obligation could put a significant burden on consumers, who may not have the money available to make a significant advance payment. In contrast, the Board reasoned that the forward commitment test would be easy to apply at consummation, and would be unlikely to be circumvented by small creditors because they would be reluctant to extend credit for transactions they do not intend to keep in portfolio unless they have the assurance of a committed buyer before extending the credit. Thus, proposed § 226.45(b)(2)(v) would have served as a means of indirectly limiting the exemption to mortgage obligations that are to be held in portfolio. The Board sought comment, however, on whether institutions could easily evade the escrow requirement by making higher-priced mortgage loans without a forward commitment in place and thereafter selling them to non-exempt purchasers and how to address this possibility without relying on post-consummation events.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Among the commenters, there was a divergence of opinion on how this provision would work in practice. One trade association commenter stated that the forward commitment requirement would prevent creditors from selling portfolio mortgage obligations in the future. This appears to be a misreading of the Board's proposal, as it would not have restricted the sale of higher-priced mortgage loans. The Board's proposed § 226.45(b)(2)(v) instead merely provided that, so long as the higher-priced mortgage loan was not subject to a forward commitment at the time of consummation, the higher-priced mortgage loan could later be sold on the secondary market without requiring an escrow account to be established at that time. One consumer advocacy group, concerned about the possibility that creditors would use the provision to skirt the escrow requirements, suggested a blanket rule that higher-priced mortgage loans that are exempt must be maintained in the portfolio of the creditor or, alternatively, that upon sale secondary market purchasers be required to establish escrow accounts for such mortgage obligations.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>After reviewing the comments received, the Bureau believes that the Board's proposal is an appropriate method to implement the requirements of TILA section 129D(c)(3), as both creditor and consumer benefit if an escrow account is established at consummation of the transaction, rather than months or years later. Indeed, allowing a consumer to avoid having to make a single large lump-sum payment after consummation is part of the basic purpose of establishing an escrow account. Accordingly, the Bureau is following the approach in the Board's proposal by adopting § 1026.35(b)(2)(v) to require that for a higher-priced mortgage loan to be exempt from the requirements under § 1026.35(b)(1), the higher-priced mortgage loan must not be subject to a forward commitment to be acquired by a creditor that does not satisfy the conditions of § 1026.35(b)(2)(iii). Comment 35(b)(2)(v)-1 clarifies that a higher-priced mortgage loan that is subject to a forward commitment is subject to the escrow requirement under § 1026.35(b)(1), whether the forward commitment refers to the specific transaction or the higher-priced mortgage loan meets prescribed criteria of the forward commitment, along with an example. As discussed separately in the Bureau's 2013 ATR Final Rule, the Bureau is also adopting language in § 1026.43(f) to provide that qualified mortgage status is not available to balloon-payment mortgages that would otherwise qualify for the exemption if the transactions are subject to a forward commitment at the time of consummation.</analysisParagraph>

            <analysisParagraph>As noted above, the Dodd-Frank Act substantially codified the Board's escrow requirement for higher-priced mortgage loans, but with certain differences. One of those differences is the higher threshold above the average prime offer rate established by the Dodd-Frank Act for determining when escrow accounts are required for transactions that exceed the maximum principal balance eligible for sale to Freddie Mac (“jumbo” transactions). In general, the coverage thresholds are 1.5 percentage points above the average prime offer rate for first-lien transactions and 3.5 percentage points above the average prime offer rate for subordinate-lien transactions. Under section 1461 of the Dodd-Frank Act, however, Congress established a new threshold of 2.5 percentage points above the average prime offer rate for “jumbo” transactions. Under an interim final rule published concurrently with the Board's 2011 Escrows Proposal, the Board implemented this special coverage test for “jumbo” transactions by amending its existing escrow requirement for higher-priced mortgage loans in § 226.35(b)(3). <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 76 FR 11319 (Mar. 2, 2011) (the Board's 2011 “Jumbo” Final Rule).</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Under the Board's 2011 Escrows Proposal, proposed § 226.45(a)(1) would have provided that a higher-priced mortgage loan is a consumer credit transaction secured by the consumer's principal dwelling that exceeds the applicable pricing threshold as of the date the transaction's rate is set. The Board's proposed § 226.45(a)(1) incorporated the special, separate coverage threshold for “jumbo” transactions, as provided by the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition, as discussed above, the Board's proposed § 226.45(a)(1) would have based “higher-priced mortgage loan” status on a comparison of the transaction's “transaction coverage rate,” rather than its APR, to the average prime offer rate.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>A few commenters suggested that the proposed thresholds should be reconsidered. However, the Bureau believes the current thresholds capture the expansion intended by Congress and is therefore generally adopting proposed § 226.45(a)(1) as § 1026.35(a)(1). As discussed above, however, the Bureau is suspending consideration of the transaction coverage rate until it considers the proposed expansion of the definition of finance charge in connection with the TILA-RESPA Final Rule. Accordingly, the final rule continues to base the definition of higher-priced mortgage loans on a comparison of the transaction's APR to the average prime offer rate. The Bureau will consider comments received concerning the transaction coverage rate proposal in connection with the TILA-RESPA Final Rule. Comment 35(a)(1)-1 clarifies how to determine if a transaction is a higher-priced mortgage loan by comparing the annual percentage rate to the average prime offer rate. Comment 35(a)(1)-2 clarifies when the comparison between the annual percentage rate and the average prime offer rate should occur. Comment 35(a)(1)-3 clarifies how to determine whether a transaction is a higher-priced mortgage loan when the principal balance exceeds the limit in effect as of the date the transaction's rate is set for the maximum principal obligation eligible for purchase by Freddie Mac.</analysisParagraph>

            <analysisParagraph>As added by section 1461 of the Dodd- Frank Act, new TILA section 129D(e) codifies the current provision stating that escrow accounts that are established in connection with transactions secured by condominium units need not reserve funds to cover mortgage-related insurance, found in existing § 1026.35(b)(3)(ii)(B), and expands it to other, similar ownership arrangements involving governing associations that have an obligation to maintain a master insurance policy. The Board's proposed § 226.45(b)(2)(ii) would have provided that insurance premiums need not be included in escrow accounts for transactions secured by dwellings in condominiums, planned unit developments (PUDs), or similar arrangements in which ownership requires participation in a governing association, where the governing association has an obligation to the dwelling owners to maintain a master policy insuring all dwellings.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Several commenters suggested that even with this expanded definition other ownership structures might not be captured by the Board's proposed exemption. The Bureau is responding to these comments by revising the proposed language to adopt the umbrella term “common interest community,” which one commenter had suggested would be sufficiently broad to capture the various arrangements under which a governing association has an obligation to the dwelling owners to maintain a master policy insuring all dwellings. The Bureau is adopting the Board's proposed comment 45(b)(2)(ii)-1 as comment 35(b)(2)(ii)-1, which parallels existing comment 35(b)(3)(ii)(B)-1, but with conforming amendments to reflect the expanded scope of the exemption. The Bureau also is adopting the Board's proposed comment 45(b)(2)(ii)-2 as comment A22b)(2)(ii)-2 to provide details about the nature of PUDs and to clarify that the exemption is available for not only condominiums and PUDs but also any other type of property ownership arrangement that has a governing association with an obligation to maintain a master insurance policy. Following a request from one commenter, the Bureau additionally adds comment 35(b)(2)(ii)-3 to clarify that properties with multiple governing associations would also qualify for the limited exemption provided in § 1026.35(b)(2)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
